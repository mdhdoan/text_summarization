He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - "perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium" - were signed to indies.

The story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.

"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band," he told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme.

Factory were the label of both Joy Division - who became New Order after singer Ian Curtis committed suicide - and the Happy Mondays.

Wilson believes Raw T could be "to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records".
