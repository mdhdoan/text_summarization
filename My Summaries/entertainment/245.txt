The story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.

"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band," he told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme.

The group are set to release their first single on 21 February, and follow it up with an album, Realise And Witness, in March.

Factory were the label of both Joy Division - who became New Order after singer Ian Curtis committed suicide - and the Happy Mondays.

He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - "perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium" - were signed to indies.
