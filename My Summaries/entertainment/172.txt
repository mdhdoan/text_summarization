Ireland has been the most successful country in the show's history with seven victories, followed by the UK, France and Luxembourg with five each.

Stars of the Eurovision Song Contest from the show's 50-year history are to compete against each other to celebrate the contest's anniversary.

Viewers will choose 14 past songs to be performed by the original artists or others in the spirit of the originals.

Fans will then vote as usual to pick the all-time best Eurovision song during the show in Denmark in October.

The 50th annual contest will be held in Kiev, Ukraine, in May, after Ukrainian singer Ruslana won last year.
