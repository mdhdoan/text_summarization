Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby re-entered the charts at number eight, following its recent success at the Oscars.

Hide And Seek, which was knocked off the top of the US box office by Boogeyman last month, fell one place.

The low-budget horror film Boogeyman has knocked Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek from the top spot at the UK box office.

The film, which scored Oscar nominations for Don Cheadle and British actress Sophie Okonedo, made £507, 596 in its first week of nationwide release.

The boxing drama, which won four awards including best film and best director, has made £4.4m to date.
