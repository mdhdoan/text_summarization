NBC will encourage viewer donations during an hour-long show featuring musical performances on 15 January.

Meanwhile 70 Hong Kong music and movie stars re-recorded We Are the World in Mandarin and Cantonese to raise funds.

Actress Sandra Bullock has donated $1m (Â£525,000) to The American Red Cross and actor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged a "sizable" aid contribution to Unicef.

The song will not be released as a single, but will be played regularly during a Chinese telethon on Friday in aid of victims of the Boxing Day disaster.

It follows a two-hour telethon carried by all four major US television networks 10 days after the 11 September terror attacks in 2001.
