At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians.

He was driving Shakur's car at the time and was shot in the head.

Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees.

A 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake ID card.

Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.
