The film focuses on the six days from Scholl's arrest to the intense trial which saw Scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance.

It is one of three German films vying for a top prize at the Festival.

The film is the first South African feature in 25 years and only the second to be nominated for a Golden Bear Award.

The film drew on transcripts of Gestapo interrogations and Scholl's trial preserved in the archive of communist East Germany's secret police.

The film is entitled U-Carmen eKhayelitsha or Carmen in Khayelitsha after the township in which the story is set.
