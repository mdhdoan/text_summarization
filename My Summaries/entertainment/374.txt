However, the Spider-Man series has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (Â£857m) worldwide.

Many of Lee's other creations, including X-Men and Daredevil, have been turned into films in the past five years.

Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films.

A third Spider-Man film is scheduled for release in 2007.

Comic book veteran Stan Lee is to team up with producer Robert Evans to create a movie featuring a new superhero.
