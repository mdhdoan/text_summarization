Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films.

Many of Lee's other creations, including X-Men and Daredevil, have been turned into films in the past five years.

"In this world where people are looking for something different, Stan's idea was to create a concept not seen before to become an evergreen franchise for Paramount."

A third Spider-Man film is scheduled for release in 2007.

Foreverman will focus on a character who has to face problems in everyday life as well as using his special powers to save the world.
