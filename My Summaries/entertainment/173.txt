TV channel Five has been criticised for sending "offensive" and "threatening" advertising material to viewers for a new show about murder scene scientists.

The promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series, a spin-off from the highly successful CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series, which also runs on Five.

A Five spokesman said: "In light of the efforts we have made to make the nature of the contents so transparent we are surprised a very small minority of recipients have mistaken it as anything else.

Five said it had received 100 complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was "obvious this material is promoting a drama".

"Everyone who was sent this promotion has expressed an interest in receiving details about this particular genre of programming on various websites.
