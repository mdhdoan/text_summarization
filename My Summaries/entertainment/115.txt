The 32-year-old rapper has enjoyed six US top 10 albums since bursting onto the music scene with hit songs like What's My Name?

The woman said she was assaulted after a recording of the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show on the ABC network in 2003.

US rapper Snoop Dogg has been sued for $25m (Â£13m) by a make-up artist who claimed he and his entourage drugged and raped her two years ago.

The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Friday, says the woman's champagne was spiked and she was then assaulted.

The woman waited two years to sue because she was trying to negotiate a settlement with the media companies, her lawyer, Perry Wander, said.
