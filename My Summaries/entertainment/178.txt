The programme suffered poor viewing figures on its debut on the Fox network three weeks ago, and has lost one in five of its viewers since then.

The show is seen as Fox's answer to The Apprentice featuring tycoon Donald Trump, a ratings hit for rivals NBC.

Sir Richard's show sees a group of young entrepreneurs compete to become the president of his business empire.

Entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's US TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, is proving a flop in the ratings.

But Fox has said it plans to stick with Branson's show throughout its 12-episode run.
