Entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's US TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, is proving a flop in the ratings.

Sir Richard's show sees a group of young entrepreneurs compete to become the president of his business empire.

"Creatively we're extremely pleased with the show and hope the audience will find it," he added.

The show is seen as Fox's answer to The Apprentice featuring tycoon Donald Trump, a ratings hit for rivals NBC.

The Rebel Billionaire has averaged five million viewers and is 91st in the rankings of all prime-time shows.
