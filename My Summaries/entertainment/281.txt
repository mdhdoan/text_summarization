Nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide, and in September 2004 simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the US albums chart.

He has had 12 UK hit singles, including Hot in Herre, Dilemma and recent number one Over and Over.

"It would appear that with ticket sales over 5,000, many others have expressed their right to find Nelly's music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on," he said.

Tim Dean, director of the Arkansas State University venue, said ticket sales had been brisk.

Mr Rodgers, of the Fullness of Joy Church, said he was concerned about the rapper's lyrics that include references to drugs, sex and violence, and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women.
