The actress and singer dropped out at the last minute and has now cancelled all European promotion of the film Shall We Dance?

"This film was a labour of love for me, and I want to thank everyone involved in bringing it to you, from the cast, to the film director, to the crew."

Other stars who turned out on the night included Honor Blackman, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly and actress Anita Dobson.

The film's director Peter Chelsom said he was disappointed that Lopez did not attend.

The red carpet boasted waltzing dancers in honour of the film's ballroom dancing theme.
