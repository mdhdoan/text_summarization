The film tells the story of two adolescent boys who are subjected to a harsh regime when their strict father returns after a 10-year absence.

Ross, who is the presenter of BBC One's Film 2005, was also involved in the deliberations.

A shortlist of six films from around the world had been drawn up from which the panel chose.

A viewer poll saw director Zhang Yimou's martial arts epic Hero emerge as the favourite with 32% of votes cast.

The winner was chosen by a panel which included X Files actress Gillian Anderson, critic Roger Clarke and Touching the Void director Kevin McDonald.
