The film-maker will reportedly meet executives from New Line Cinema this week to discuss the 12th film in the long-running 'stalk and slash' series.

That film saw Jason battle Freddy Krueger, star of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.

According to the industry newspaper, New Line had been trying to make another sequel involving Ash, the hero of the Evil Dead movies, but was unable to agree terms with director Sam Raimi.

Tarantino is said to be intrigued by the prospect of building a new film around one of the horror genre's most recognised figures.

The original film, released in 1980, has spawned ten sequels based around mask-wearing murderer Jason Voorhees.
