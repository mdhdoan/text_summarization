Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe.

Ms Kite suggested Jackson's associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser's family after the airing of Martin Bashir's film Living with Michael Jackson.

In the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.

Jurors saw the film, in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim, on Tuesday.
