Best actress winner Imelda Staunton, who wore a green chiffon dress that sparkled with sequins and beads, told the BBC News website that Vera Drake was the highlight of her career.

Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him.

British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it "meant a lot" to be at the ceremony.

The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films.

Her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty low-budget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an Oscar nomination.
