Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him.

British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it "meant a lot" to be at the ceremony.

Her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty low-budget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an Oscar nomination.

The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for The Aviator star Leonardo DiCaprio, who paused in the chilly February air to sign autographs for the throngs.

The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films.
