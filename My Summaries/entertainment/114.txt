The singer, who has been linked to supermodel Kate Moss, was arrested after police were called to the Islington hotel in response to claims that a man had been assaulted.

Mr Doherty left The Libertines at the end of June 2004, but continued performing with his band Babyshambles.

But his lawyer said the money could not be raised on time.

Singer Pete Doherty will have to spend the weekend in jail because he could not come up with Â£150,000 bond money for his bail on time.

Mr Doherty, 25, was arrested following an alleged incident in a London hotel on Wednesday evening.
