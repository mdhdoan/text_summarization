Mr Doherty left The Libertines at the end of June 2004, but continued performing with his band Babyshambles.

The singer, who has been linked to supermodel Kate Moss, was arrested after police were called to the Islington hotel in response to claims that a man had been assaulted.

But his lawyer said the money could not be raised on time.

Singer Pete Doherty will have to spend the weekend in jail because he could not come up with Â£150,000 bond money for his bail on time.

The former Libertines singer had been granted bail with curfew restrictions at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court on charges of robbery and blackmail.
