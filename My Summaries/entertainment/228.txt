Plans for a separate Joy Division film had been announced at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but the project did not get off the ground as it failed to get the backing of Curtis's family.

"People have different ideas as to why Ian committed suicide, so maybe the film will reflect those different views," he told the BBC News website.

The life of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis is to be made into a film, it has been announced.

The Manchester-based production is called Touching From A Distance, after a book by Curtis's widow Deborah which forms the basis for the film.

The musician committed suicide in 1980 aged 23, shortly before the band were due to go on tour in the US.
