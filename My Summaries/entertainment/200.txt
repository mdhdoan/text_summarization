Contestants Paul Burrell, Joe Pasquale, Janet Street-Porter and Fran Cosgrave were told by hosts Ant and Dec. Natalie Appleton's decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told.

Former All Saints singer Natalie Appleton,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial.

Model Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle.

The four remaining stars will do a joint Bushtucker Trial on Sunday.

And on 26 November singer Brian Harvey quit as a contestant after he had a blazing row with Janet Street-Porter.
