Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (Â£40.7m) worldwide.

Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004.

However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough.

The prequel project was originally announced in 2001, with actor Liam Neeson in the lead role and John Frankenheimer as director.
