Stern announced in October that he was leaving conventional radio, where his syndicated show goes out across the US, for the relatively restriction-free satellite service.

Stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on 3 January.

Citadel pulled Stern's show from stations in New York and Pennsylvania.

Media giant Viacom has also reportedly agreed to the FCC's demands that if Stern is issued with another indecency violation then his show must be pulled from all of its stations.

Stern will join the Sirius subscription service, which is not governed by US regulators, next year.
