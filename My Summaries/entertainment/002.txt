Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited New York on Monday to help promote the festivities.

Other stars are expected to join the line-up in the coming months, and the Danish royal family will attend.

The pair were at a Manhattan library to honour US literary critic Harold Bloom "the international icon we thought we knew so well".

Denmark is holding a three-day celebration of the life of the fairy-tale author, with a concert at Parken stadium on 2 April.

Other ambassadors include actors Harvey Keitel and Sir Roger Moore, athlete Cathy Freeman and Brazilian soccer legend Pele.
