US rap duo OutKast's trio of trophies at the MTV Europe Awards crowns a year of huge success for the band.

The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya!

But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US.

"They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects.

"Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business," says the DJ.
