Screenwriter and producer Debra Hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic Halloween, has died in Los Angeles aged 54.

Later in her career, Hill formed a production company with her friend Lynda Obst, making a string of hit films including Oscar nominee The Fisher King and teen comedy Adventures In Babysitting.

Directed by John Carpenter, it made over $60m (Â£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time.

At the time of her death she was working on a film about the last two men pulled from the rubble of the Twin Towers following the 11 September terror attacks in 2001.

She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men.
