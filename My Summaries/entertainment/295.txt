Mary Poppins star Dame Julie Andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in London's West End.

The show has been one of the West End's hottest tickets since opening in December, winning two Olivier Awards.

Sir Cameron said he hoped the production, which cost Â£9m to bring to the stage, was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by PL Travers.

Proceeds from Thursday's show will go to charities including Absolute Return for Kids (Ark), international relief agency Operation USA and drama school Lamda.

The gala performance saw Dame Julie, 69, return to the theatre where she had her first starring role in a performance of Humpty Dumpty in 1948.
