Mary Poppins star Dame Julie Andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in London's West End.

Sir Cameron said he hoped the production, which cost Â£9m to bring to the stage, was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by PL Travers.

The show has been one of the West End's hottest tickets since opening in December, winning two Olivier Awards.

The Mary Poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Richard Eyre with choreography by Matthew Bourne.

Proceeds from Thursday's show will go to charities including Absolute Return for Kids (Ark), international relief agency Operation USA and drama school Lamda.
