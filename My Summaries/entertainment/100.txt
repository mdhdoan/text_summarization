Comedy Meet The Fockers has held on to the number one spot at the North American box office for a second week.

This weekend's top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (£65.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year.

But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (£7.7m).

The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand.

Meet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year's Eve, when it made $12.2m (£6.2m), and New Year's Day, when it took $18m (£9.4m).
