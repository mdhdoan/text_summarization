BBC Radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.

The permanent replacement for late DJ John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot.

Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales.

All three will play "diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial" songs under the banner of the OneMusic show.

Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the "challenge" of "keeping his legacy alive" with unpredictable music.
