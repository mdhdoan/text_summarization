Hollywood star Tom Hanks was in London's Leicester Square for the UK premiere of Polar Express.

"Christmas is a special time of the year and you get out of it what you put into it," added the two-time Academy Award winner.

The "performance capture" technique enables Hanks to play a number of roles, including the eight-year-old boy who is at the centre of the story, and Father Christmas.

Polar Express is based on a children's book which tells the story of a young boy's journey to meet Santa Claus.

The West End landmark was turned into a festive landscape complete with snow and carol singers to celebrate the arrival of the animated film.
