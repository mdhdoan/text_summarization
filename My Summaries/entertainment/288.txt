"A lot of people don't want to see it happen, but we're responding to the two most important groups - our family and our fans."

Chart-topper 50 Cent, real name Curtis Jackson, said the truce came on the anniversary of the death of the Notorious BIG in 1997, who was part of a volatile feud between the east and west coast rap scenes.

50 Cent announced he has launched the G-Unity Foundation "to help people overcome obstacles and make a chance for the better in their lives".

But the pair shook hands as they handed over money to music projects for New York's deprived areas on Wednesday.

50 Cent is no stranger to feuds, with rapper Ja Rule among the targets for ridicule in his songs.
