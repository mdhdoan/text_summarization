The film, A Different Story, chronicles Michael's life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles.

Singer George Michael has said that a new film about his life is the start of a retirement from public view.

Michael said that the film, directed by Southan Morris, would put his two decades of fame into context.

The film also deals with the loss of Michael's partner Anselmo Feleppa from an Aids-related condition in 1993.

"It's almost as much for me as for my fans, in terms of trying to make sense of the last 22 years and bring it to a close in a proper way," he said.
