New York band Scissor Sisters have won a gig of the year award for their performance at this year's V Festival.

Glasgow's Franz Ferdinand earned a place at number nine for their home-town performance in April.

The award was voted for by listeners of Virgin Radio, which compiled a top 10 which was mostly dominated by newcomers on the music scene this year.

At number seven was Oxfam's Make Fair Trade gig at London's Hammersmith Apollo in October, which featured performances by REM, Razorlight and Coldplay's Chris Martin.

He added: "The Scissor Sisters are one of the most original, eccentric bands to come through and it's no surprise the British public are lapping up their performances."
