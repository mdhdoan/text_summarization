US District Court Judge Robert W Sweet ruled Lee should get a tenth of profits generated since November 1998 by Marvel TV and movie productions involving the company's characters.

A judge has upheld Lee's demand for 10% of Marvel's profits from the hugely successful Spider-Man films.

The New York court did not rule on Lee's claims to a share of profits from some Spider-Man and Hulk movie merchandise, which will be decided at a future trial, Marvel said.

He said: "I am gratified by the judge's decision although, since I am deeply fond of Marvel and the people there, I sincerely regret that the situation had to come to this."

The ruling also means he is entitled to a slice of profits from DVD sales and certain merchandise.
