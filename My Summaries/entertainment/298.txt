The New York court did not rule on Lee's claims to a share of profits from some Spider-Man and Hulk movie merchandise, which will be decided at a future trial, Marvel said.

Spider-Man and its sequel made $1.6bn (Â£857m) at box offices worldwide.

A judge has upheld Lee's demand for 10% of Marvel's profits from the hugely successful Spider-Man films.

He said: "I am gratified by the judge's decision although, since I am deeply fond of Marvel and the people there, I sincerely regret that the situation had to come to this."

He said the company - where he worked for more than 60 years - had gone back on agreement to give him the 10%.
