R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards.

It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.

During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself.

She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man.

His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B.
