R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards.

It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.

During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself.

The autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in New Zealand and Australia.

But in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter Teja, who was born in March 2001.
