Film director Ken Loach, fashion designer Hussein Chalayan and former Blur guitarist Graham Coxon have all designed postcards for the sale.

Postcards by artists including Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin have sold just hours after the opening of the Royal Academy of Arts annual Secrets sale.

She said the people that had bought the famous name postcards had arrived early and had spent time studying each work.

Money raised from the sale will go towards the RCA's Fine Art Student Award Fund which supports students with grants and bursaries.

The famous sale is now in its 11th year.
