The band were forced to cut short Monday night's show in Sheffield, and have cancelled Tuesday's Glasgow date.

The band had originally been scheduled to play four dates in the UK as part of a world tour.

REM played accoustic versions of their hits Losing My Religion, I've Been High, Leaving New York and The One I Love to the Sheffield Arena audience on Monday.

US rock band REM have been forced to cancel concerts after bass player Mike Mills was taken to hospital suffering from "severe flu-like symptoms".

Those who had a ticket for the show in Glasgow are being advised to retain their ticket stub so they can attend the new date.
