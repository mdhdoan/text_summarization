Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance.

Film actress Annette Bening is up for an Oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia.

Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.

However the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood's greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford.

But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes.
