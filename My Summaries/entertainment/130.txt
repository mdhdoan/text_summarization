Sir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York.

He said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a "sing-along" like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa.

"It's a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, 'it's such a good song', but it's such a sad song," Read said.

The song, titled Grief Never Grows Old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio DJ Mike Read.

Read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the DEC. "I'd only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one," he added.
