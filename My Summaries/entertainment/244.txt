The Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.

The Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards' disappearance.

By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression.

Edwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band's US tour to promote The Holy Bible.

The remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band's royalties into an account held in his name.
