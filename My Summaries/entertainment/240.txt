Record company Sony BMG is now manufacturing 5,000 more copies of each single than originally planned to meet demand, taking the total number of copies of each song on sale to about 28,000.

The late US legend Elvis Presley is likely to score his third UK number one single in three weeks on Sunday, according to early sales figures.

A Fool Such As I would become the 1,001st number one single in UK chart history after One Night took the 1,000th place on Sunday.

Presley's 18 original number ones are being reissued as limited release singles, with fans eager to buy the set to fill a collector's box that went on sale in the first week.

Bookmakers have offered odds of 10/1 for all Presley's 18 hits to go back to number one.
