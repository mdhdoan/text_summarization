The new video of former Westlife singer Brian McFadden has been pulled after a Dublin school complained about being associated with his song Irish Son.

McFadden, whose debut solo album is released next week, has said that every song is autobiographical and "a true story".

McFadden, who quit chart-topping group Westlife in March, went to number one in September with his first solo single Real To Me.

Alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs, half of which have been written with Robbie Williams' former collaborator, Guy Chambers.

McFadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the song's lyrics, saying it had "cell blocks".
