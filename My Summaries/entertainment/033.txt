This third Harry Potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on DVD.

The most interesting pieces are an interview with JK Rowling in Creating The Vision and Conjuring A Scene, a short featurette about the making of the film's big moments.

This is the first Potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book.

Gone are the warm, bright colours found in the two earlier films, Alfonso Cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous - and looks even better here than in the cinema.

The film itself is the reason to buy this DVD.
