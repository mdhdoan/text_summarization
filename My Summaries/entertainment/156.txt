The Soul Train Music Awards, which started 18 years ago, celebrates artists in R&B, hip-hop, rap and gospel music.

Newcomer Ciara - who recently beat Elvis Presley to the UK number one spot - has four nominations, while Alicia Keys has three.

The singer, whose album Confessions has sold close to eight million copies in the US alone, is already in the running for eight Grammy Awards.

Chart-topping R&B star Usher is leading the field at this year's Soul Train Awards, with five nominations.

Usher's work with rappers Ludacris & Lil Jon won him nominations for best R&B-soul or rap music video and best R&B-soul or rap dance cut for the song Yeah!, while his duet with Keys, My Boo, earned the pair a nod for best R&B-soul single.
