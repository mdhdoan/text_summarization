Newcomer Ciara - who recently beat Elvis Presley to the UK number one spot - has four nominations, while Alicia Keys has three.

The Soul Train Music Awards, which started 18 years ago, celebrates artists in R&B, hip-hop, rap and gospel music.

Keys' album The Diary of Alicia Keys was also up for best R&B-soul album by a female.

The singer, whose album Confessions has sold close to eight million copies in the US alone, is already in the running for eight Grammy Awards.

Chart-topping R&B star Usher is leading the field at this year's Soul Train Awards, with five nominations.
