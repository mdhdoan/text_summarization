In 2002, Aguilera won best pop collaboration for the hit track Lady Marmalade with Lil' Kim, Maya and Pink, and last year she picked up the award for best female pop vocal performance for Beautiful.

Her most recent single, Car Wash, featuring Missy Elliott, reached number four in the UK charts last November.

New York-born Aguilera reached number one in the UK with her debut hit Genie in a Bottle in October 1999.

Pop star Christina Aguilera is to marry music executive Jordan Bratman, the singer's agent has confirmed.

Her early success was cemented by two further Grammys in subsequent years.
