Gallagher was arrested along with drummer Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage after the brawl in Munich in December 2002.

Gallagher lost two front teeth in the fight, which led to the band abandoning their German tour.

The band said they were victims of an "unprovoked attack" in a nightclub.

Oasis singer Liam Gallagher has been fined 50,000 euros (Â£35,000) after a fight in a German hotel two years ago.

At the time, police said a "physical altercation" broke out among the musicians at about 0200 local time.
