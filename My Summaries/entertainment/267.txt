The 12th annual T in the Park festival, which takes place at Balado near Kinross in July, sold out just four days after the line-up was announced.

Both Green Day and The Foo Fighters last played at the festival in 2002, the same year Oasis and Basement Jaxx were among the headline acts.

Last year tickets sold out 10 weeks before the festival but organisers confirmed that all 130,000 for the two-day event had been sold.

"We are extremely proud that fans are so excited about T in the Park that they have made absolutely sure that their place at Balado is booked for 2005, and we will deliver one of the greatest events yet for them in July."

Green Day, the Foo Fighters and Keane are among the acts that had already been lined up to appear at the event.
