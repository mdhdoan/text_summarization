Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's "bullying" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.

VOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?

Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.

Happy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1.

"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground," Greer said.
