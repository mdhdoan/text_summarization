In 1970, RPM weekly magazine presented Holiff with a special award as the Canadian music industry's man of the year.

Mr Holiff, who was also a concert promoter, managed Cash's career between 1960 and 1973, quitting when he thought the singer's career had peaked.

He briefly dabbled in acting, before setting up offices in Nashville and Los Angeles for his concert and artist promotion business.

The former manager of Johnny Cash, Saul Israel Holiff, has died at the age of 79, his family said.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Mr Holiff served as a rear air gunner in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, afterwards setting up a drive-in restaurant.
