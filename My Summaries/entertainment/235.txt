Most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of Thunderbirds, which was voted Record Of The Year on the ITV1 show.

A statement from the band's record company Universal said frontman Charlie Simpson planned to spend some time working with his other band, Fightstar.

The band, which also includes members Matt Jay and James Bourne, made the top ten with their self-titled debut album, as well as the follow-up, A Present For Everyone, in 2003.

The trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments.

The band have had eight top three hits, including four number ones, since they first hit the charts in 2002.
