The Stop Murder Music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in Sizzla's UK tour being cancelled in November, forced Mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw Beenie Man dropped from an MTV show in August.

Instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years.

The industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said.

But the artists - Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, TOK, Capleton and Vybz Kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments.

The reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups.
