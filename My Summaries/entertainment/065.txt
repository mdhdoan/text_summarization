Animation charms Japan box office

Oscar-winning director Hayao Miyazaki's latest film has set a new Japanese box office record, with 1.5bn yen ($14.3m) in two days, according to reports.

The film won the Golden Osella for outstanding technical contribution at this year's Venice Film Festival.

The film's distributor Toho expects 40 million people to see it in total - almost one third of the country's population - it added.

The film is about an 18-year-old girl who is trapped in an old woman's body after being put under a spell by a witch.
