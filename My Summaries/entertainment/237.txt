Size, whose New Forms album won the 1997 Mercury Music Prize, said gun use was "nothing to be glamorised".

R&B star Beverley Knight said she sang on an anti-gun single after being "haunted" by the fatal 2003 shooting of two teenage girls in Birmingham.

"Over the last 10 years, I have seen a lot of things happen and it is nothing to be glamorised, it really isn't," he said.

Knight and drum 'n' bass star Roni Size have released No More in a bid to reduce gun use among young people.

Knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in Aston, near Knight's Birmingham home.
