Media giant Viacom has paid out $3.5m (Â£1.8m) to end investigations into indecency in its US radio and TV shows.

Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church.

The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States.

The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by "shock jock" Howard Stern and two New York DJs.

After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.
