Media giant Viacom has paid out $3.5m (£1.8m) to end investigations into indecency in its US radio and TV shows.

The payment is not related to the FCC's $550,000 (£293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jackson's breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January.

Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church.

After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.

The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by "shock jock" Howard Stern and two New York DJs.
