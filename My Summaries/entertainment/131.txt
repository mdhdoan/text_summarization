There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.

Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!

Kapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week's Brit Awards, including best group and best album.

Some of Britain's wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc.

As a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it!
