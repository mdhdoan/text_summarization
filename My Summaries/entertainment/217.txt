Surf show Baywatch has won the title of worst TV import of all time in a poll of UK television executives.

The Simpsons and Dallas and 24 were among the magazine's list of the best all-time imports from the US.

Other American shows which won praise were The X-Files, I Love Lucy, Twin Peaks and Star Trek.

Broadcast magazine said: "British TV never realised how low it could go before Jerry showed the way."

Baywatch rose to the top of the list for having "mind-numbingly predictable scripts: beachgoer is saved from drowning," according to the magazine.
