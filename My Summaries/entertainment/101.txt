International films will be given the same prominence as US films at next year's Sundance Film Festival, with movies dominated by the theme of war.

Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.

Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister.

The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.

The Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya.
