Fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season, including the traditionally quiet summer season.

Fox has changed this plan, launching new shows in May instead of June.

She was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the network's established reality shows, such as American Idol, which is due to start its fourth series this week.

One of the new shows will be the animated series American Dad, made by Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy.

Five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from Fox's schedules, Ms Berman said.
