It will be the actor's first appearance on the small screen since he appeared in BBC series Ballykissangel in 1999.

Other film stars to have appeared in Scrubs include Heather Graham, while Friends actor Matthew Perry has guest-starred and directed an episode of the show.

Scrubs, which appears on the NBC network in the US and has been shown on Channel 4 on British television, is an off-beat comedy about a group of hospital doctors.

Actor Colin Farrell is to make his debut on US television in medical sitcom Scrubs, according to Hollywood newspaper Daily Variety.

Farrell is pencilled in to play the role of Crockett in a film version of 1980s police drama Miami Vice.
