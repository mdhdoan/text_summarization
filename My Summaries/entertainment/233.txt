Elvis' single Jailhouse Rock became the UK's number one on Sunday.

Jailhouse Rock is now the 999th number one single in UK pop history.

Record company SonyBMG are releasing Elvis' 18 number one singles at the rate of one a week in Britain, complete with original artwork and a collector's box.

Hit single One Night will follow next week - with the chance of becoming the 1,000th number one as interest surrounding Elvis' birthday grows.

His Graceland, Tennessee, home was the focus for US celebrations with four days of events including a concert by the Memphis Symphony Orchestra.
