Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows.

However, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4's gameshow Don't Forget Your Toothbrush.

And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.

The prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers.

To help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside.
