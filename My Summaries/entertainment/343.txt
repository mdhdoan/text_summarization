US musical Sweet Charity has cancelled its run on Broadway after poor ticket sales for its early shows.

Applegate, who starred in TV comedy Married With Children, had been hoping to make her Broadway debut in the show.

The 33-year-old injured herself while performing in Chicago, and had been hoping to recover in time for its official New York opening on 21 April.

Sweet Charity tells the story of Charity Hope Valentine, a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man.

Producer Barry Weissler said he was "deeply proud" of the show, but said the decision to close it was "painful but fiscally responsible".
