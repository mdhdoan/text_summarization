Other new artists in this year's list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third.

Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music's chart show, said the band had "great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound".

Boy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UK's best-selling album of 2004, were seventh.

In last year's survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point.

Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003.
