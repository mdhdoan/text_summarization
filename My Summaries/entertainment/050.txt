Willis is seeking medical expenses after he said he was hit in the head by a firework during the filming of the 2002 movie, produced by the firm.

Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film was poorly received by critics and did not perform strongly at the box office.

The lawsuit said the star has endured mental and physical injuries as a result of the alleged incident.

In Tears of the Sun Willis plays a US military commander who disobeys orders to try and help save a doctor and patients trapped in the Nigerian jungle.

Actor Bruce Willis is suing Revolution Studios over an injury he said he suffered while making Tears of the Sun.
