Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs until Sunday.

The film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war.

The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears.

For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences.

Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.
