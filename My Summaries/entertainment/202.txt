The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen.

The corporation plans to spend up to Â£138m on Freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the UK, and are aware of it.

The Public Accounts Committee called for the National Audit Office to be given a "free hand" to investigate how the BBC offers value for money.

"Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money," said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh.

A BBC spokeswoman said: "We share the committee's interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well.
