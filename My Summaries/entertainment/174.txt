Last Saturday's show was beaten in the ratings by the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.

The Pop Idol-style show votes off a group or contestant every week - the two that receive the lowest public vote have to perform a second time before the judges make a final decision.

ITV's controller of entertainment, Claudia Rosencrantz, said she had no hesitation in recommissioning the show.

The final of the first series will take place on 11 December.

"There's much more to come this series as we build towards the final next month and it's great to have secured this terrific format for our viewers for another series," she said.
