In a statement on the band's website, Lightbody said: "I started the group with Mark 10 years ago and he was a massive part of Snow Patrol and my life throughout that decade."

Last month, they were the big winners in Ireland's top music honours, the Meteor Awards, picking up accolades for best band and album.

The group, originally from Northern Ireland, has only achieved mainstream success in the last year with the single Run and award-winning album Final Straw.

Snow Patrol had "no other course of action" but to ask their co-founder and bassist to leave the band, lead singer Gary Lightbody has said.

The band is set to play support to U2 on a number of summer stadium gigs.
