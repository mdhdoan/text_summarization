BBC comedy Coupling was remade with a US cast, but lost its primetime slot on the NBC network due to disappointing ratings.

Plans to create a US soap based on the BBC's EastEnders have reportedly been drawn up by the Fox TV network.

Primetime soaps on US television have made a recent comeback, following the success of ABC serial Desperate Housewives.

The series takes a "darkly comedic" look at the goings-on of a group of characters living in the suburbs.

The original EastEnders was pulled from BBC America last year after it proved a failure in the ratings.
