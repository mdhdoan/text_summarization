He has also starred in a number of films, including Heathers, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and more recently Churchill: The Hollywood Years.

The role will be played by understudy Joey Collins until Slater joins the show.

Philip Rinaldi, a spokesman for the show, said the play's 15 March opening date remains unchanged.

Slater, 35, is replacing actor Dallas Roberts in the Tennessee Williams drama, which opens next month.
