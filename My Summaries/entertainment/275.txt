A smash hit on Broadway before moving to London, the show also won best musical performance in a supporting role for Conleth Hill, who plays director Roger DeBris.

It led the nominations going into Sunday's ceremony at London's Hilton hotel, up for nine awards.

Mary Poppins' awards came for best choreography and best musical actress for its star Laura Michelle Kelly.

The play also won National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner best director and Bennett got a special award for outstanding contribution to British theatre.

Both shows are stage adaptations of 1960s films.
