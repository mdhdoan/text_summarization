The US Vibe awards will be held again next year despite a stabbing which happened during the ceremony.

The performer is one of the members of 50 Cent's G-Unit group, which is signed to Dr Dre's record label.

The rapper, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, is due in court on 20 December after being arrested on one charge of attempted murder and a second charge of assault with a deadly weapon.

He said not holding the awards would be counter to the work the magazine has done to promote hip hop music.

Rapper Young Buck has been charged after allegedly stabbing a man who hit Dr Dre as he was about to receive a lifetime achievement award.
