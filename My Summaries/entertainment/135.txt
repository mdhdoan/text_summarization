The man who was stabbed, Jimmy James Johnson, suffered a collapsed lung and is in a stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital.

The US Vibe awards will be held again next year despite a stabbing which happened during the ceremony.

The performer is one of the members of 50 Cent's G-Unit group, which is signed to Dr Dre's record label.

Rapper Young Buck has been charged after allegedly stabbing a man who hit Dr Dre as he was about to receive a lifetime achievement award.

He said not holding the awards would be counter to the work the magazine has done to promote hip hop music.
