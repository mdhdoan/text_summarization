Murdered director Theo van Gogh's controversial film Submission has been pulled from the Rotterdam Film Festival because of security fears.

The festival opens with the French film The 10th District Court, Moments of Trials made by Raymond Depardon.

Two of Van Gogh's other films will be shown as planned, including the theatrical world premiere of his last feature 06/05.

The event sees 14 films competing to win three Top Tiger Awards which aim to introduce promising new talent.

The film is critical of the treatment of women under Islam.
