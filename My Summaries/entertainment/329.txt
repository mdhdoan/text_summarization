Murdered director Theo van Gogh's controversial film Submission has been pulled from the Rotterdam Film Festival because of security fears.

The festival opens with the French film The 10th District Court, Moments of Trials made by Raymond Depardon.

The event sees 14 films competing to win three Top Tiger Awards which aim to introduce promising new talent.

New sections added to this year's festival include Cinema of the Future and Cinema of the World, with special focus on Russian and south-east Asian productions.

The film is critical of the treatment of women under Islam.
