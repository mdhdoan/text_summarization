The show's highest audience came at Christmas 1986, when more than 30 million tuned in to see Den, played by Leslie Grantham, hand divorce papers to wife Angie.

The show's ratings have since settled down to about 12 million per episode.

But he came back to the show in September 2003.

If the ratings are confirmed, the episode will have given the soap its highest audience for a year.
