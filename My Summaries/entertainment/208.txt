Chart stars Duran Duran are to appear in a VH1 special in the US including interviews and concert footage.

"They seemed like a perfect fit with our audience," said Rick Krim, VH1's vice president of music and talent.

The band recently released a new album, Astronaut, the first from the original line-up since 1983.

They will also tour Japan and the US next year.

Simon Le Bon said earlier this year that the group were not trying to update their sound too much.
