The band recently released a new album, Astronaut, the first from the original line-up since 1983.

"They seemed like a perfect fit with our audience," said Rick Krim, VH1's vice president of music and talent.

They will also tour Japan and the US next year.

Chart stars Duran Duran are to appear in a VH1 special in the US including interviews and concert footage.

The show airs on Tuesday and will feature a studio performance, behind the scenes footage and fan interviews.
