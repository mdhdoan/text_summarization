"I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in," said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray.

In the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years.

The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films.

This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year."

The film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m).
