Hollywood stars Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth attended the British premiere of new film, Beyond the Sea, in London's Leicester Square on Thursday.

"I knew absolutely nothing about Bobby Darin before this film, but now I'm a huge fan," said Bosworth, who attended the premiere with British boyfriend Orlando Bloom.

Spacey, 45, wrote, directed and starred in the film, inspired by the life of 1950s croooner Bobby Darin.

"Making this film was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life."

Bosworth, 21, plays Darin's wife - real life Hollywood actress Sandra Dee.
