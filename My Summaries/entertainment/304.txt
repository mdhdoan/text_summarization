Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (Â£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop.

Michelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books.

"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest."

Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.
