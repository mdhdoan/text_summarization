Gervais said: "The show has won an awful lot of awards in the last couple of years, too much.

Speaking after receiving the award for best comedy, Walliams said: "It was a real shock but I don't think we deserved to beat The Office which is a great show and more than just a comedy.

The show also won the people's choice award, which is the only gong on the night voted for by viewers.

The BBC show beat The Office Christmas Special in the best TV comedy category and took the people's choice award.

Other winners at the awards included Caroline Quentin, who took home best TV comedy actress for Life Begins and Von Trapped.
