Gervais said: "The show has won an awful lot of awards in the last couple of years, too much.

Speaking after receiving the award for best comedy, Walliams said: "It was a real shock but I don't think we deserved to beat The Office which is a great show and more than just a comedy.

It was later commissioned for BBC Three, where it proved a huge success, with the second series also shown on BBC One.

The BBC show beat The Office Christmas Special in the best TV comedy category and took the people's choice award.

The show also won the people's choice award, which is the only gong on the night voted for by viewers.
