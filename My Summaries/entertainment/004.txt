The 10 authors shortlisted for a Richard and Judy book award in 2005 are hoping for a boost in sales following the success of this year's winner.

The best read award, on Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan's Channel 4 show, is part of the British Book Awards.

"It was very hard to follow last year's extremely successful list, but we think this year's books will do even better," said Richard and Judy executive producer Amanda Ross.

David Mitchell's Booker-shortlisted novel, Cloud Atlas, makes it into this year's top 10 along with several lesser known works.

This year's winner, Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, sold over one million.
