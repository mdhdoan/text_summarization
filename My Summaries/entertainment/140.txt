Earlier this week, Bono announced that the band would play two shows at the venue, which holds almost 80,000 people, due to the phenomenal demand for tickets.

Many fans camped on the streets of the Irish capital for three days to ensure they were first in line at Ticketmaster in St Stephen's Green Shopping Centre, where the tickets went on sale on Friday.

The tour begins in San Diego on 28 March and will cover 13 US cities.

The Dublin dates on June 24 and 25 form part of the worldwide Vertigo tour.

Tickets for the two concerts at the city's Croke Park stadium were released at 8am on Friday morning.
