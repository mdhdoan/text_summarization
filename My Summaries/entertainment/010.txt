The show, which has been a controversial sell-out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues.

But the work's author, US playwright Eve Ensler, says it is all about women's empowerment.

"I'm extremely outraged at the hypocrisy," the play's organiser in Uganda, Sarah Mukasa, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.

The four Ugandan NGOs organising the play intended to raise money to campaign to stop violence against women and to raise funds for the war-torn north of the country.

"I'm amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women's rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up."
