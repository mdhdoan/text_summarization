Despite three nominations, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star Imelda Staunton.

It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh's film.

A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: "It is disappointing not to have more British winners."

Before Sunday's ceremony Owen was bookmakers' favourite for his role in romantic drama Closer that had already clinched him a Golden Globe award.

Winslet said she was "ecstatic" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
