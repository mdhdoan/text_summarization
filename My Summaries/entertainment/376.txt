The Da Vinci Code is being made into a film starring Tom Hanks.

French booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of The Da Vinci Code is translated into French.

Such is the success of The Da Vinci Code in France, special tours have been organised to trace Langdon's footsteps, including the the Louvre museum and the Saint Sulpice Church.

Angels and Demons was written before The Da Vinci Code, which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and been translated into more than 40 languages, since it was released in 2003.

The Da Vinci Code is set in Paris - including the Louvre - and has sold around one million copies in France.
