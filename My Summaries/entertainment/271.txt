Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive.

"The problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out," he stated.

"I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful."

"It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned."

"So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie."
