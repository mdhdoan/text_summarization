Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive.

German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright.

Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem.

But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold.

"I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful."
