However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few.

"Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going."

"At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds," Sergio Gera, the programme's chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Service's Assignment programme.
