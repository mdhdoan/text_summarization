Up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them.

At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.

The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.

The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday.

Charles Evans Jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film, and won a producer's credit.
