There was more follow up to Brits success for Franz Ferdinand won best rock act and best British group last week.

Also capitalising on Brits success were the Scissor Sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two.

Soldier, by Destiny's Child, Ti and Lil Wayne, debuted at number four, while Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem, fell from number three to number five.

Brits success has helped return Keane's award-winning album Hopes and Fears back to the top of the UK album chart.

The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.
