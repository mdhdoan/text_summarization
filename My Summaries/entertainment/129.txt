Brits success has helped return Keane's award-winning album Hopes and Fears back to the top of the UK album chart.

Also capitalising on Brits success were the Scissor Sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two.

Soldier, by Destiny's Child, Ti and Lil Wayne, debuted at number four, while Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem, fell from number three to number five.

Elvis' Wooden Heart, which entered the chart at number two, is the sixth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of Presley's birth.

There was more follow up to Brits success for Franz Ferdinand won best rock act and best British group last week.
