Mark Mackie, director of Regular Music, said: "It is fantastic news and it really shows REM's commitment to their Scottish fans that they are coming back to Glasgow for what will be a truly unique gig."

Ticketweb and the SECC box office will write to customers who bought tickets for the February gig asking if they want to attend the new show.

US band REM have announced plans to perform for 10,000 Scottish fans in a rescheduled gig.

Fans who bought tickets for the original 22 February show can attend the rescheduled concert.

The band will play in what has been dubbed Europe's biggest tent on Glasgow Green on Tuesday, 14 June.
