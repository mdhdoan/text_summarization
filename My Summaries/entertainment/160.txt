Dido, Robbie Williams and Chris Martin are among those featured on the new version of Do They Know It's Christmas?, which is raising money to fight hunger in Africa.

But the single is now on sale for 79p - the usual cost of a song from iTunes - with Apple donating a further 70p to the charity for each song downloaded.

More than 72,000 copies of the new Band Aid single were sold on its first day of release on Monday, according to sales figures.

A copy of the original 1984 song is also available for download at 79p - with all proceeds going to the charity.
