Devon singer Joss Stone and rock band Muse won coveted Brit awards during the event's 25th anniversary.

Born Jocelyn Stoker, the Devon diva started her career in a BBC talent programme, and was then discovered at a New York audition by a US record executive, Steve Greenberg.

After beating Amy Winehouse, Jamelia, Natasha Bedingfield and PJ Harvey to the best British female prize, Joss Stone said: "I don't know what to say.

Muse, whose members met in south Devon, beat Franz Ferdinand, Jamie Cullum, Kasabian and The Libertines for best British live act.

Her second album Mind, Body & Soul reached number one in the UK charts last October and went straight into the US charts at number 11.
