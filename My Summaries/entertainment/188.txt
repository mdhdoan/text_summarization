The show forms part of the BBC's festive schedule.

The BBC is yet to confirm the final two stars who will battle it out to become Ice King or Queen.

At the end of the series, one celebrity will be crowned the winner.

Veteran presenter Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly will host the programme, which follows hot on the heels of the current Saturday night series Strictly Come Dancing.

The contestants on Stars on Thin Ice will each be paired up with a professional skater and will learn a new routine every week.
