The couple, who married in Los Angeles last September, claimed staff took photographs of them which were later sold.

Pop star Britney Spears has attacked "false" and "desperate" US tabloid magazines, questioning their honesty after they reported she was pregnant.

In a letter on her website, the singer named celebrity tabloids Us Weekly, In Touch and Star as the worst offenders.

Us magazine was unrepentant about their decision to publish, saying: "Britney should start her own magazine if she'd like to dictate her own coverage."

But the chart-topping singer's letter did not shed any further light on those stories.
