The 34-year-old made reference to the band's aggressive brand of music and its young fans in his parting statement.

Their best performance to date in the UK has been 2002's Here To Stay, which reached number 12, while their album Untouchables, released in the same year, made it to number four.

The guitarist with US rock band Korn has quit the music business, saying he made the decision after experiencing a religious awakening.

Korn have enjoyed a moderate degree of chart success in the UK, with 10 singles breaking into the Top 40.

Welch added that he would appear at a church in Bakersfield to explain how he "got to this place in life".
