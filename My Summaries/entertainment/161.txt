Premiership footballer and record company boss Kevin Campbell has gained a court injunction stopping R&B singer Mark Morrison from releasing an album.

He signed to Mr Campbell's label a year ago and has released one single, with the label saying the album was due for release on 24 January.

"I was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record, which was not properly promoted.

The Everton striker signed Morrison to his fledging 2 Wikid Records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album Innocent Man.

Now he is attempting to prevent Morrison releasing the album on Monday through another label.
