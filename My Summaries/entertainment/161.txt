Premiership footballer and record company boss Kevin Campbell has gained a court injunction stopping R&B singer Mark Morrison from releasing an album.

He signed to Mr Campbell's label a year ago and has released one single, with the label saying the album was due for release on 24 January.

"I was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record, which was not properly promoted.

He added: "The whole world is waiting for this album and it will come out on December 27.

Now he is attempting to prevent Morrison releasing the album on Monday through another label.
