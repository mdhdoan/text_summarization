Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.

"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever."

"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did," he said.

If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers.

In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.
