The awards, now in their 20th year, honour quirky low-budget films, all of which must have a degree of independent financing.

Among the other films receiving four nominations apiece were Brother to Brother, a drama about a young gay black man forced to live on the streets, Robbing Peter and Primer.

The awards are held on 26 February, the day before the Oscars.

The awards were announced by actors Selma Blair and Dennis Quaid in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

Controversial biopic Kinsey, starring Liam Neeson as sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, was one of four films to get four nominations.
