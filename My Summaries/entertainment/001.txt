It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree.

Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.

A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery.

The plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children's charity ArtWorks.

Its light bulb adornments are dimmed, ordinary domestic ones joined together with string.
