The award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the 9-11 Commission Report looking into the events of the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US.Last year's honorary winner, Stephen King, accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers.This year's fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as Philip Roth's The Plot Against America and instead chose five little-known books, all by New York-based women.Her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness.But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.
