New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada.

"I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer.

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.
