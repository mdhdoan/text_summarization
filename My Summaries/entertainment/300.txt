"Hollywood or Bollywood, it's the box office that determines whether something is a passing phase or a trend," says Adarsh.

The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams.

British actress Antonia Bernath is making her debut in Kisna - the Warrior Poet, marking a growing trend for non-Indian stars to appear in Bollywood films.

Directed by Bollywood veteran Subhash Ghai, the film is set in the British Raj and Bernath plays an army general's daughter who falls in love with a rural boy, Kisna.

Films are one of India's biggest exports and those like Lagaan and Monsoon Wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture.
