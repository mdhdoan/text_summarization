The Musicians' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face "an uphill struggle" to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical.

A Department for Media, Culture and Sport spokeswoman said: "We're aware that people are experiencing problems, and are working with the US embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it."

A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $1,300 (Â£680) simply for obtaining a visa.

"The US is the world's biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy," says Mr McCune.

"The US market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success, and we're still going to fight to get in there.
