Charles, who died in 2004, got honours including record and album of the year, while Alicia Keys and actor Jamie Foxx performed a musical tribute to him.

Keys, looking to replicate her Grammys success of 2002, when she won five, picked up best R&B song for You Don't Know My Name and best R&B album for The Diary of Alicia Keys.

R&B star Keys won four awards herself at the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles.

But Elvis Costello, who had four nominations, and Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand, who were both up for three awards, got nothing.

She also shared the award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group with Usher for My Boo.
