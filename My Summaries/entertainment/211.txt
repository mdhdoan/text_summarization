Phil Redmond, now chairman of Mersey TV, told Tessa Jowell he would run it with its current remit intact for the next 10 years.

Redmond also brought teen soap Hollyoaks to Channel 4 and created Grange Hill, the school-based drama serial which was first broadcast on BBC One in 1978.

He was awarded the CBE for services to drama earlier this year.

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.
