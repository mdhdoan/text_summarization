"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year," said chief executive officer John Woodward.

Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.

The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize.

Arnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday.

The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.
