The tally for its DVD and video sales soared past the film's opening week US box office takings of $56m (£29.7m).

Films which are expected to earn strong home video returns are usually timed for release in the busiest retail season which falls before Christmas.

Shark Tale, whose voice cast includes Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger and Martin Scorsese, sold more than 6 million DVDs and videos across the United States and Canada.

Oscar-nominated animation Shark Tale has raked in $80m (£42.4m) in the first week of its US DVD release becoming the year's best-selling home video so far.

The best-selling home video of last year was the Dreamworks hit Shrek 2, which took an estimated $458 m (£242.7m) in North America alone.
