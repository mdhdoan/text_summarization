South West teenage singing sensation, Joss Stone, has been nominated in three categories in Wednesday's Brit awards.

Born Jocelyn Stoker, the Devon diva started her career in a BBC talent programme, and was then discovered at a New York audition by a US record executive, Steve Greenberg.

Her second album Mind, Body & Soul reached number one in the UK charts last October and went straight into the US charts at number 11.

The teenager also has Grammy nominations in the US, normally dominated by home-grown acts.

The 17-year-old singer is hoping to tour in Japan, Australia and the US in 2005.
