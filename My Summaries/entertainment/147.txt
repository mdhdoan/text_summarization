The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.

US rappers Beastie Boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song Pass the Mic.

A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton's recording.

The punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist James Newton's Choir in their track from 1992.

Sampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song.
