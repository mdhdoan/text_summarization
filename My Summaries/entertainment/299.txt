Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film.

The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been "delighted" with the choice of Fry for the role.

Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May.

Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.

Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members.
