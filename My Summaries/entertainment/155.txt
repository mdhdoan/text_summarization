A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks has gone on sale in the US, after years of legal wrangles.

The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991.

The set, released on Tuesday, features three CDs and a DVD of rare performance and rehearsal footage.

The band's development ended tragically when songwriter Kurt Cobain committed suicide in April 1994.

It was blocked by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who did not want unreleased song You Know You're Right on the box set.
