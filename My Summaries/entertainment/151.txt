Eminem's latest album soared to the top of the US chart after just three days on sale in record shops.

The rapper was criticised earlier this year after a performance on BBC One's Top of the Pops in April led 12 viewers to complain he was "lewd" and "offensive".

The US star will play just two songs at a night showcasing his label Shady Records at the Islington Academy.

Eminem performed on HMS Belfast on Friday, which is docked on the River Thames, where he filmed two songs for BBC One's Top of the Pops.

Eminem's album includes the track Mosh, which is a tirade against US President Bush and the presence of US troops in Iraq.
