But a spokesman for the English National Ballet told BBC News that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were British, around a quarter of the company's dancers were from the UK.

Dance teacher Eve Trew, who has taught ballet for over 48 years, told BBC News she had seen a "vast" change over the years.

Fewer children in the UK are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like Darcey Bussell, and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers.

The RAD found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11.

"I think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies," she said.
