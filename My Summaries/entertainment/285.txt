Newcomer The Game's debut reached the top of the charts five weeks ago, while 50 Cent's second collection The Masscre was released in the US at the end of last week.

50 Cent also appears on rap protege The Game's song How We do, number four in the US but now outside the UK top ten.

50 Cent, who burst onto the music scene in 2003, has had less success in the UK charts, with three singles making the top ten.

Last May, R&B star Usher scored a chart first, with three concurrent singles in the US Top 10, a feat which was previously matched only by The Bee Gees and The Beatles.

But in the US, he headed the 2003 end of year charts for the album and R&B and hip hop artists.
