50 Cent also appears on rap protege The Game's song How We do, number four in the US but now outside the UK top ten.

Newcomer The Game's debut reached the top of the charts five weeks ago, while 50 Cent's second collection The Masscre was released in the US at the end of last week.

50 Cent, who burst onto the music scene in 2003, has had less success in the UK charts, with three singles making the top ten.

But in the US, he headed the 2003 end of year charts for the album and R&B and hip hop artists.

Rapper 50 Cent has become the first solo artist to have three singles in the US top five in the same week.
