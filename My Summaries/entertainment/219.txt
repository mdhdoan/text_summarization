Veteran US television host Dick Clark is in hospital in Los Angeles after suffering a mild stroke.

Clark, who produces the Golden Globe and American Music Awards, disclosed last year that he was suffering from diabetes.

Clark was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contribution to the music industry.

The 75-year-old presented long-running show American Bandstand from 1956-87 and has since hosted game shows and produced award ceremonies.
