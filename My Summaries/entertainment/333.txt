A large number of bets on actor Colin Salmon to become the first black James Bond were dismissed as a publicity stunt a month ago.

The next Bond film, originally due for release in 2005, has been delayed until 2006 due to Sony's takeover of the MGM studio.

Scott first found fame in the TV series Soldier Soldier and has since then starred in such films as Mission Impossible II and the wartime drama Enigma.

Others thought to be in the running include Star Wars actor Ewan McGregor and Australian star Hugh Jackman, both of whom have odds of 4-1.

The firm closed the book on Friday, saying "insider information" could have contributed to the number of bets.
