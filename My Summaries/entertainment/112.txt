Rock 'n' roll legend Elvis is set to top the UK singles chart on Sunday, 27 years after his death.

The last time he topped the charts was with the remix of the little-known song A Little Less Conversation, which was number one in June 2002.

His record One Night will be released the following week, followed the week after by A Fool Such As I, as part of his record company SonyBMG's new Elvis campaign.

If the record does make the top spot, it will be Elvis' 19th UK number one.

If Jailhouse Rock does reach number one on Sunday, it will be the 999th in the history of the UK pop charts.
