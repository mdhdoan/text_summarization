Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby.

The Aviator leads the shortlist, but critics believe the night may belong to Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby.

Scorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York.

British actors in attendance include nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet and director Mike Leigh.

A host of stars are expected to grace the red carpet outside Los Angeles' Kodak Theatre, including Johnny Depp, Cate Blanchett and Leonardo DiCaprio.
