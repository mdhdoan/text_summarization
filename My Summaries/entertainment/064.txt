Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby.

The Aviator leads the shortlist, but critics believe the night may belong to Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby.

British actors in attendance include nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet and director Mike Leigh.

A recent poll of US pundits found Eastwood's boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the Howard Hughes biopic.

UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.
