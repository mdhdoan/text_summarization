Other successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC Two for the first month since last July.

Celebrity Big Brother attracted fewer viewers than its 2002 series.

The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.

Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004.

BBC Two's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004.
