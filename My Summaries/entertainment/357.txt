But Vera Drake scored best director for Mike Leigh while Imelda Staunton took the hotly contested best actress award.

"It's an immense privilege to have been allowed the freedom to make as uncompromising a film as I think Vera Drake is and an epic with such a small budget."

Hollywood blockbuster The Aviator and low-budget British movie Vera Drake have shared the main honours at the 2005 Bafta film awards.

I'm so thrilled and so grateful and I'm delighted that the success of Vera Drake has boosted sales of hair nets and pinnies, which is very good," she said on accepting her award.

The Aviator took four awards in all, also collecting best make-up and hair and production design, while Vera Drake also scooped best costume design.
