Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).

The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year.

Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%.

The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation.

The surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004.
