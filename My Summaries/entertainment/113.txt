The lawsuit seeks to force Wal-Mart to censor the music or remove it from its stores in Maryland.

The parents of a 13-year-old girl are suing US supermarket giant Wal-Mart over a CD by rock group Evanescence that contains swear words.

It also seeks damages of up to $74,500 (Â£38,660) for every customer who bought the CD at Maryland Wal-Marts, and also naming record label Wind-Up Records and distributor BMG Entertainment in the legal action.

It needs to be removed from the shelves to prevent other children from hearing it," said Mr Skeens of Brownsville.

"While Wal-Mart sets high standards, it would not be possible to eliminate every image, word or topic that an individual might find objectionable," Wal-Mart spokesman Guy Whitcomb told the Herald-Mail of Hagerstown.
