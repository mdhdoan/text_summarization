They are embarking on a world tour later this year which will take in 60 cities across the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Mantooth added that the pair became lovers in 1990, after which she abandoned her career as a documentary film-maker to move in with the guitarist at his Malibu home.

She is asking a Los Angeles court to award her half the musician's property, a monthly allowance and damages.

The woman, Robin Mantooth, said Mars promised her repeatedly that he would provide financial support in the event of the couple breaking up.

They originally formed in the early 1980s and scored six hits in the UK, including Girls Girls Girls in 1987.
