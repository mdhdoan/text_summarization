A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.

Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a "positive experience".

The WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Monday's show.

WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches...

If she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (Â£52,590).
