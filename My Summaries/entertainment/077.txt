This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film.

Sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.

It's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good.

The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.

It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier films: there's no True Grit, for instance, though there is Hellraisers.
