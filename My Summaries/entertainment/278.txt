The inclusion of downloaded music in the official singles chart has been delayed for a month.

The US has already merged downloaded singles into its Billboard Hot 100 chart.

BPI chairman Peter Jamieson said: "The inclusion of download formats in the Official UK Singles Chart is the most significant development in the charts for 20 years.

Download formats will now be included in the Official UK Singles Chart for the first time in the chart published on 17 April - the sales week beginning 10 April.

The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) had planned to include download formats in the chart from 20 March.
