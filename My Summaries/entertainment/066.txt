Ticket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002's all-time high.

"Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money," said Mr Dergarabedian.

Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year.

Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.

Overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year's Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings.
