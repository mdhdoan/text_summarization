The list also acknowledges key influences and trends in the world of film and broadcasting.

To illustrate their point, the AFI cited ABC affiliates refusal to air Steven Spielberg's film Saving Private Ryan in an unedited form over fears of possible fines.

The Institute also cited the death of actor Marlon Brando and the changing landscape of TV news in the US.
