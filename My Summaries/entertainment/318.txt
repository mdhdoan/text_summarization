The band are also working in the studio on new material, their first since the 1982 album Avalon.

Original band members Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzerana, Andy Mackay and Paul Thompson will take to the stage on the Saturday night of the festival.

Roxy Music were formed in 1971 by Ferry, Mackay and Brian Eno, with Manzanera joining the following year.

REM have already been confirmed as headliners for the three-day event, which takes place from 10-12 June.

Morrissey will also play on Saturday at the festival, while Supergrass and Idlewild have been confirmed for the Friday.
