The band are also working in the studio on new material, their first since the 1982 album Avalon.

Roxy Music were formed in 1971 by Ferry, Mackay and Brian Eno, with Manzanera joining the following year.

Roxy Music's back catalogue was re-released in 2000, leading to the band undertaking a world tour in 2001.

Original band members Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzerana, Andy Mackay and Paul Thompson will take to the stage on the Saturday night of the festival.

Morrissey will also play on Saturday at the festival, while Supergrass and Idlewild have been confirmed for the Friday.
