But the director award went to Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby.

British actress Imelda Staunton won the CFCA best actress for the gritty abortion drama Vera Drake, adding to a growing list of awards she has won for her performance in the Mike Leigh film.

Sideways has already been voted best film by critics associations in New York and Los Angeles and has been nominated for a Golden Globe.

The Chicago Film Critics Association (CFCA) named it winner in five categories including best film and best actor for Paul Giamatti.

The CFCA awarded Thomas Haden Church the best supporting actor prize and Virginia Madsen the best supporting actress award for their roles in the film.
