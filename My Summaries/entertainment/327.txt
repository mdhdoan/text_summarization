The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe.

The Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week.

"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety."

Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.

Kidman sought the "apprehended violence" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police.
