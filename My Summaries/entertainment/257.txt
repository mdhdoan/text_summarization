Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time.

Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved.

Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist.

Proposals to open a museum dedicated to Jimi Hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father.

Janie Hendrix, the guitarist's stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him.
