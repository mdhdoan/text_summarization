Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved.

Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist.

Proposals to open a museum dedicated to Jimi Hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father.

Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time.

Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre.
