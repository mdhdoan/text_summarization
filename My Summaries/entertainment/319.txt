Mr Sillerman's deal to buy the Presley estate sees him control the operation of Graceland, as well as money from the late star's music and films.

Pop Idol supremo Simon Fuller has sold his 19 Entertainment company to an US entrepreneur in a $156m (£81.5m) deal.

The company was set up 15 years ago by Mr Fuller, taking the name from his first successful single - 19 by Paul Hardcastle.

The 19 firm handles a roster of music artists, TV shows and PR strategies for stars including the Beckhams.

There will also be a further £19.2m in either cash or stocks by the end of the financial year in June.
