Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials.

Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: "Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it's one of the best shows on TV in the last decade."

The Office's Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.

The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America.

Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.
