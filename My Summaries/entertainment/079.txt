Ross, who is the presenter of BBC One's Film 2005, was also involved in the deliberations.

Tragedy struck the production of The Return when one of the young stars, 15-year-old Vladimir Girin, drowned in a lake where some of the film's scenes were set.

The film tells the story of two adolescent boys who are subjected to a harsh regime when their strict father returns after a 10-year absence.

A shortlist of six films from around the world had been drawn up from which the panel chose.

Directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev, The Return previously won the 2003 Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival.
