Tragedy struck the production of The Return when one of the young stars, 15-year-old Vladimir Girin, drowned in a lake where some of the film's scenes were set.

The film tells the story of two adolescent boys who are subjected to a harsh regime when their strict father returns after a 10-year absence.

Ross, who is the presenter of BBC One's Film 2005, was also involved in the deliberations.

A shortlist of six films from around the world had been drawn up from which the panel chose.

A viewer poll saw director Zhang Yimou's martial arts epic Hero emerge as the favourite with 32% of votes cast.
