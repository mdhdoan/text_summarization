The new programme will combine with archive show TOTP2, mixing new music with footage of classic bands.

The move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show, which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on BBC One.

About three million people a week were watching the show on Fridays - less than half the total it was attracting in the mid-1990s - as the programme went up against popular ITV soap Coronation Street.

A BBC spokeswoman said Andi Peters would continue as executive producer on the show.

The programme will have a close relationship with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on Sundays.
