After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.

His first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess.

Warner will distribute Cuaron's films in several languages outside the US.

Harry Potter director Alfonso Cuaron has signed a three-year deal with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers, according to Variety trade magazine.

Cuaron's other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.
