Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war.

After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.

Warner will distribute Cuaron's films in several languages outside the US.

His first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess.

Cuaron's other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.
