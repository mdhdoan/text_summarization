Actor Gerard Jugnot - star of the Oscar-nominated film The Chorus - has beaten Gerard Depardieu to become France's best-paid actor of 2004.

The Chorus is nominated for best foreign film at Sunday's Oscar ceremony.

On Saturday, it will compete for the title of best film against fellow nominee A Very Long Engagement in France's Cesar film awards.

Despite starring in five films in 2004, Depardieu made 3.35m Euros (Â£2.31m) putting him third place in the chart.

"His name [Depardieu] is no longer sufficient to guarantee the success of a film," said Le Figaro newspaper.
