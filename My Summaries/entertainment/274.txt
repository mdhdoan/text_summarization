The long-running presenter said: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CD:UK team and all the viewers that have watched, supported the show and let me gate crash their Saturday morning.

Cat Deeley has resigned as host of ITV1's Saturday morning children's music show CD:UK after six years.

"I've had a great few years, met some really incredible people and been given some wonderful opportunities," the presenter said.

Deeley will host her last show on 5 March and guest presenters will stand in until a replacement is found.
