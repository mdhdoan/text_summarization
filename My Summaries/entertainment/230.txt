Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed.

She was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single More Than A Woman went to number one in the UK.

A New York appeals court has told Blackground Records that only the singer's parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death.

Late R&B star Aaliyah's record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.

Blackground Records' lawyer Frank Penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.
