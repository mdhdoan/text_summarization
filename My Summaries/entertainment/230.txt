A New York appeals court has told Blackground Records that only the singer's parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death.

Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed.

She was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single More Than A Woman went to number one in the UK.

Late R&B star Aaliyah's record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.

The 22-year-old singer's family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003.
