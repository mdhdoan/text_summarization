A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening.

Geraldine McCaughrean has picked up the children's fiction award for the third time for Not the End of the World.

As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread.

As well as writing poetry, Symmons Roberts also makes documentary films.

Orange Prize winner Andrea Levy has seen her book Small Island win the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award.
