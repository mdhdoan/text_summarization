Despite his Oscar nomination, he had few other lead roles and became a familiar supporting actor on TV and in film.

O'Herlihy, whose Oscar nomination was for Luis Bunuel's The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, died at his home in Malibu, California, a spokesman said.

Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy, who was nominated for best actor at the 1955 Oscars, has died at the age of 85.

The year he was nominated, the Academy Award was won by Marlon Brando for On the Waterfront.

The actor began his film career in the 1940s, playing Macduff to Orson Welles' Macbeth in 1948, and was also a regular in on the Dublin stage.
