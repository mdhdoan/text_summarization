Casino Royale, author Ian Fleming's first James Bond book, is to be the next Bond film, with Goldeneye director Martin Campbell behind the camera.

Producers say no decision has yet been made on who will become the seventh actor, including Niven, to play Bond on film.

Among the favourites to take over the coveted role are Scottish actor Dougray Scott, Oscar nominee Clive Owen and Australian star Hugh Jackman.

In addition to the 1967 film, it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor Barry Nelson as an Americanised "Jimmy" Bond.

It will be the 21st James Bond film to hit the big screen, and speculation has been rife over who will play the lead.
