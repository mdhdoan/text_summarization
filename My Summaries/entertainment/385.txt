Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of The Hobbit.

Jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake King Kong, which is currently in production in Wellington.

The picture, which stars Naomi Watts and Oscar winner Adrien Brody, is due to be released in December.

Jackson, who is currently filming a remake of Hollywood classic King Kong, said he thought that the sale of MGM studios to the Sony Corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project.

The Oscar winner said on a visit to Sydney there was a "desire" to make it, but not before lengthy negotiations.
