Producer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film's backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films.

McDonald's announced it was to scrap its "supersized" meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film.

Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.

The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald's fast food for an entire month.

The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels.
