Brown, 42, was lead singer with The Stone Roses, one of the most seminal bands in British rock, until they split in 1996.

He said Brown was arrested at his hotel after the show at the Great American Music Hall but released without charge.

A fan jumped on stage and attacked the singer, who then became involved in a fracas with a security guard, Fiction Records spokesman Paul Smernicki said.

He has since forged a successful solo career, scoring nine UK top 30 singles since 1998.

Former Stone Roses singer Ian Brown was arrested after a fight during a concert in San Francisco on Tuesday, his spokesman has said.
