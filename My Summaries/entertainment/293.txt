Brown, 42, was lead singer with The Stone Roses, one of the most seminal bands in British rock, until they split in 1996.

A fan jumped on stage and attacked the singer, who then became involved in a fracas with a security guard, Fiction Records spokesman Paul Smernicki said.

Former Stone Roses singer Ian Brown was arrested after a fight during a concert in San Francisco on Tuesday, his spokesman has said.

He said Brown was arrested at his hotel after the show at the Great American Music Hall but released without charge.

Mr Smernicki said he had been told a fan "rugby-tackled" the singer during the gig, which resulted in "pushing and shoving".
