The US band, who opened the show with Take Your Mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.

US band Scissor Sisters led the winners at the UK music industry's Brit Awards, walking off with three prizes.

A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.

Of the 15 Brit awards for achievements in 2004, 10 were won by artists tipped in the BBC News website's Sound of 2004 list of artists to watch, published at the start of last year.

Williams' track beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the UK music industry ceremony.
