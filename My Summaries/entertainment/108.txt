The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the star's legal team was hit by family illness.

Reporters covering singer Michael Jackson's trial in California have asked to see questionnaires completed by potential jurors.

"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case," a motion by Mr Jackson's lawyers stated.

"I can't sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him," she said.

Describing Mr Jackson as "a good person", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial.
