The new person will be in charge of the Â£9m budget and their role will be to develop shows outside the capital, both within the BBC and with independent production companies.

Ms Bennett said the new roles would benefit those making programmes within the BBC as well as those making shows for the channel independently.

The changes come as part of a shake-up of several departments to create shows that appeal to a wider range of people.

A number of new roles are being created in each department, including a head of comedy commissioning based in Glasgow.

Jane Lush, controller of entertainment commissioning, said, "Entertainment and comedy are incredibly important to our audiences; I'm confident these changes will help us get the very best programmes on screen."
