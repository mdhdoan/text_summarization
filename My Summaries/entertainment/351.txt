UK Film Council chief executive John Woodward said: "Whilst the UK has benefited hugely from its highly-qualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry."

The research was carried out jointly by the UK Film Council and industry training body Skillset.

In the lower salary bracket, 35% of women earn less than Â£20,000 a year, compared to only 18% of men.

Women in the UK film industry earn less than their male counterparts despite being better qualified, according to a study released on Wednesday.

It also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children.
