Collecting his band's award from model Naomi Campbell at the Cannes ceremony, U2 frontman Bono said in French: "I'm not from this country but I'll make a little confession to you - it's at the Cote d'Azur I feel at home."

Singer Jenifer also took home two awards, for best French female singer and best French album.

Irish band U2 have been honoured at France's biggest music awards, but were beaten to a prize by boy band Blue.
