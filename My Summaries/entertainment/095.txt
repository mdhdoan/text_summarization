Swank, who previously won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, paid tribute to Million Dollar Baby director and co-star Clint Eastwood.

Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood took the best director prize for Million Dollar Baby while its star Hilary Swank was best actress.

This give it a total of three awards while Million Dollar Baby, Sideways and Closer took two Golden Globes each.

Other UK hopes Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton went home empty-handed despite lead actress nominations for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Vera Drake respectively.

Winning a Golden Globe is said to improve a film or performer's chance of subsequently winning an Academy Award.
