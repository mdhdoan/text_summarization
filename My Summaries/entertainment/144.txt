Rapper Eminem has denied Elvis his fourth number one of the year, after his song, Like Toy Soldiers, stormed to the top of the singles charts.

Last week's number one, Elvis's It's Now or Never, slipped 13 places to number 14, but all five of his re-released songs are in the Top 40.

Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem, went in at number three.

One World Project Tsunami fundraiser, Grief Never Grows Old, slipped four places to number eight.

Like Toy Soldiers, from Eminem's Encore album, is sampled from Martika's 1980s hit Toy Soldiers.
