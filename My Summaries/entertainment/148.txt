Songwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme.

He said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from "unscrupulous" individuals.

It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.

The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry.

Music piracy, including illegally swapping music online, costs the UK music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide CD sales.
