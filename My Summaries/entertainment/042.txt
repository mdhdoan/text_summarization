South Korean film director Im Kwon-Taek has received an honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.

U-Carmen eKhayelitsha (Carmen in Khayelitsha), which is one of 21 films up for Berlin's top prize, the Golden Bear, is British director Mark Dornford-May's first feature film.

Twenty of his films are screening in a special retrospective during the festival, which runs until 20 February.

Im, who has made more than 100 films in a 40-year career, was hailed for his "remarkable visual beauty, technical innovation, and intellectual depth".

"Although his films vary in style, they all bear his unmistakable stamp: they are forceful and charged cinematographically, as well as reticent, stylised and musical," organisers said in a statement.
