The original stage production of The Sound of Music is to be performed for the first time in the Austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.

The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s.

The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.

But despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time, it is barely known inside Austria.

Many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of Austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen.
