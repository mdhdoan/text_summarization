More than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years.

Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.

"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets," festival organiser Michael Eavis said.

Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April.

No details of this year's line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.
