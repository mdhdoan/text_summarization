Movie monster Godzilla has received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, honouring both his 50th birthday and the launch of his 28th film.

An actor dressed as the giant creature breathed smoke over photographers on Monday as Godzilla received the 2,271st star on Hollywood Boulevard.

And producer Shogo Tomiyama added: "So long as Godzilla can fascinate people, I believe he will be resurrected by new generations of filmmakers in the future."

"Godzilla should thank you for this historical and monumental star," said Final Wars producer Shogo Tomiyama.

The monster was joined by co-stars including Japanese pop star and actor Masahiro Matsuoka.
