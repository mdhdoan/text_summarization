Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ won best drama, despite both films being snubbed so far at US film awards in the run-up to February's Oscars.

Michael Moore's anti-Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 has won best film at the US People's Choice Awards, voted for by the US public.

Film sequel Shrek 2 took three prizes - voted top animated movie, top film comedy and top sequel.

Moore said it was "an historic occasion" that the 31-year-old awards ceremony would name a documentary its best film.

His film was highly critical of President George W Bush and the US-led invasion of Iraq, and Moore was an outspoken Bush critic in the 2004 presidential campaign inwhich Democratic challenger John Kerry lost.
