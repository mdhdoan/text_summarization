RDF Media, which makes the show for US network ABC, has filed a damages claim for $18 million (Â£9.25 million) against Fox's Trading Spouses.

The British producers of US Wife Swap are taking legal action against a show they claim is "a blatant and wholescale copycat" of their programme.

ABC bought the rights to the British show, which was first aired in 2003 and became a hit on Channel 4.

The Fox show proved a ratings flop, while NBC's The Contender is due to begin in February.

Their show was first screened in June, and was criticised in the press for its similarities to Wife Swap.
