A major distributor of pirated DVDs of Bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years.

Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein.

The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films.

Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions.

The organisation's anti-piracy director David Martin said: "The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha.
