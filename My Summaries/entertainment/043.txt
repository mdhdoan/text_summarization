Hollywood stars including Spike Lee, Burt Reynolds and Oscar nominee Alan Alda have paid tribute to actor Ossie Davis at a funeral in New York.

He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father's funeral.

The 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in Florida, where he was making a film.

"Ossie was my hero, and he still is," said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years.

Friends and family, including actress Ruby Dee his wife of 56 years, gathered at the Riverside Church on Saturday.
