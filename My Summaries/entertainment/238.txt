Founding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed.

Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.

Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.

Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February.

"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time."
