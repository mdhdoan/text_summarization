A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film "has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike".

Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.

Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years.

The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.

Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones.
