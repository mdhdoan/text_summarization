Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.

"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year's Baftas", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet.

The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there "might well be" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night.

Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one."

Vera Drake, Mike Leigh's tale about a 1950s backstreet abortionist, is nominated in 11 categories.
