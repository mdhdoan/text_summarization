In 2002, the British Academy of Film and Television decided to split the awards into separate games and interactive ceremonies, to fully cover the range of innovation outside the gaming industry.

Categories include interactive TV, film, digital TV, mobile phones and music.

The awards, which were started in 1997, recognise the best websites, digital TV shows and CD roms.

And the Guardian takes three of a possible five nominations in the news and sport category for its website coverage of Euro 2004, the Tour de France and the US elections.
