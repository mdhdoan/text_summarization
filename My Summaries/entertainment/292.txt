Sir Elton John has composed the music.

Such are the demands of the show that producers set up a stage school in Newcastle to train potential stars for the show.

The show's opening night on 12 May at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London remains unaffected by the changes.

Child labour laws also mean the young actors can only work for a limited period each week.

Adult actors in the show include Tim Healy as Billy's father and Haydn Gwnne as his dance teacher Mrs Wilkinson.
