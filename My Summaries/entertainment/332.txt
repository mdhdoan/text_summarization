Tom Kenny, who provides the voice for SpongeBob SquarePants, hosted Sunday's ceremony at the Alex Theater, Los Angeles.

SpongeBob SquarePants was named best animated TV show while TV comedy King of the Hill picked up two prizes including one for actress Brittany Murphy's voice work.

The two movies will compete with Shark Tale in the best animated film category of the Oscars at the end of February.

The Incredibles won a total of 10 awards - but Shrek 2, which had seven nominations, went home empty-handed.

The Incredibles' awards came despite Shrek 2's greater box office success.
