Chosen by more than 11,000 theatre fans, the Theatregoers' Choice Awards named US actor Christian Slater best actor for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

Diana Rigg was best actress for Suddenly Last Summer, Dame Judi Dench was best supporting actress for the RSC's All's Well That Ends Well and The History Boys' Samuel Barnett was best supporting actor.

The Producers was named best musical, Victoria Hamilton was best actress for Suddenly Last Summer and Festen's Rufus Norris was named best director.

Partly based upon Alan Bennett's experience as a teacher, The History Boys has been at London's National Theatre since last May.

Set in a grammar school, the play also earned a best actor prize for star Richard Griffiths as teacher Hector.
