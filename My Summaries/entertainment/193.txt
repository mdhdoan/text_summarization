"The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show," said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US.

People have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the CSI TV shows, real experts say.

Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions.

Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) and its spin-offs, CSI: Miami and CSI: New York, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.

Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims.
