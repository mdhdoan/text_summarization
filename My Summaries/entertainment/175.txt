R&B star Alicia Keys is to open February's Super Bowl singing a song only previously performed there by Ray Charles and Vicki Carr.

The game and show were watched by 144 million people in the US in 2003.

It will be her first performance at the Super Bowl, which will be watched by millions in the US on 6 February.

Organisers have promised there will be no repeat of her nipple-baring incident that sparked thousands of complaints on US TV's most-watched broadcast.

Charles, who died last year, attended the school as a child in 1937.
