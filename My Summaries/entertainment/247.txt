The 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in Illinois last March.

The Onyx Hotel tour was cited as "a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of Spears, supported by elaborate costumes, complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production, lighting and other effects".

But she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song Outrageous, leading her to cancel the rest of the tour, including dates in China.

Seven London-based companies and an eighth Paris firm have been given up to 30 days to respond to the complaint.

The pop star cancelled her Onyx Hotel tour last June after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot.
