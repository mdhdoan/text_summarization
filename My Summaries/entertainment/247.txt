The 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in Illinois last March.

The Onyx Hotel tour was cited as "a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of Spears, supported by elaborate costumes, complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production, lighting and other effects".

But she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song Outrageous, leading her to cancel the rest of the tour, including dates in China.

The pop star cancelled her Onyx Hotel tour last June after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot.

"She obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee," a Jive spokeswoman said at the time.
