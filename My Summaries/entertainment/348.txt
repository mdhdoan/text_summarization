Of the 21 films in competition for the Golden and Silver Bear awards, more than half are from Europe with France particularly well represented.

Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals "a new consciousness for European films".

Some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it.

Organisers say this year's Berlin Film Festival, which opens on Thursday with period epic Man to Man, will celebrate a revitalised European cinema.

"I'm not worried that we won't be able to fill the red carpet with stars," he said, though he admitted the festival may be moved to January next year to avoid a similar clash.
