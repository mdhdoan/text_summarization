Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.

Good luck to Joss Stone, let's celebrate her victory - let's also question why, with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast - we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.

If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.

She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.

Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music.
