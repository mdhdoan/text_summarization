The international award was started in response to criticisms that the Booker Prize is only open to British and Commonwealth authors.

The new Â£60,000 award is open to writers of all nationalities who write in English or are widely translated.

The prize, which will be awarded in London in June, will be given once every two years.

The prize commends an author for their body of work instead of one book.
