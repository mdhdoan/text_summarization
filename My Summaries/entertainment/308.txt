Tautou 'to star in Da Vinci film'

She also starred as the lead role in critically-acclaimed film Dirty Pretty Things in 2002.

Oscar-winning director Ron Howard chose Tautou for the part, preferring a French actress to a big name Hollywood star.

UK actress Kate Beckinsale had been widely tipped as a possibility for the role alongside Vanessa Paradis and Juliette Binoche.
