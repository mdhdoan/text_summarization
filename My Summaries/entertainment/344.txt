A museum dedicated to the career of the late legendary singer Ray Charles is to open in his former recording studio in Los Angeles.

The building had been declared a historic landmark by the city of Los Angeles just before Charles' death in June 2004 at the age of 73.

Following his death, Charles won eight Grammy Awards, including album of the year for Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets.

Mr Digney said the recording studio and offices had been used by Charles for many years, and was where he recorded much of his last album, Genius Loves Company.
