"This award counts because the final choice of winners is made by children, who are the toughest critics of all," she said.

The prize, which is celebrating its 20th year, is billed as "the UK's biggest children's book award".

Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell's book came top in the category for six- to eight-year-olds and won the award chosen by after-school club members.

"This year's young judges chose the winners from an exceptionally strong and varied shortlist which showcases the very best in children's books today."

Biscuit Bear by Mini Grey took the top award in the under-five category.
