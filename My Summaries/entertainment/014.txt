"This award counts because the final choice of winners is made by children, who are the toughest critics of all," she said.

The prize, which is celebrating its 20th year, is billed as "the UK's biggest children's book award".

"This year's young judges chose the winners from an exceptionally strong and varied shortlist which showcases the very best in children's books today."

Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell's book came top in the category for six- to eight-year-olds and won the award chosen by after-school club members.

Julia Eccleshare, chair of the adult judging panel, said children's literature had "never looked stronger" in the prize's 20 years.
