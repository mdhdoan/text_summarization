By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations.

"Without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds," Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online.

However, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the "robotiquette" for human interaction.

In most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with groups of people.
