"Like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives," said project manager Caroline Pelletier.

Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.

"At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural, social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently," said Roger Bennett, director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association.

"Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do," he said.

As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say.
