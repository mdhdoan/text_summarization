"Users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature," said Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University.

BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, told the BBC News website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure.

"This means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure," said Mr Clark.

"We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted."

But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be "sniffed out" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment.
