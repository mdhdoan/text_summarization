"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world," Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.

The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.

The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.

The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing.

Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world.
