"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world," Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.

IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing.

The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.

The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.

The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.
