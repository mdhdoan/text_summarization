In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones.

Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others.

A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day.

More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common.

Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch.
