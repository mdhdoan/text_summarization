But the relatively low wages in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone.

"It's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network," said Mr Goodman, "and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."

The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.

"It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around," said Mr Goodman.
