The report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK.

But the relatively low wages in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone.

"It's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network," said Mr Goodman, "and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."

The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.

The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future.
