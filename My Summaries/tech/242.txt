The number of personal computers worldwide is expected to double by 2010 to 1.3 billion machines, according to a report by analysts Forrester Research.

The report comes less than a week after IBM, a pioneer of the PC business, sold its PC hardware division to China's number one computer maker Lenovo.

The growth will be driven by emerging markets such as China, Russia and India, the report predicted.

"Today's products from Western PC vendors won't dominate in those markets in the long term," Simon Yates, a senior analyst for Forrester, said.

The report forecast that there will be 80 million new PC users in India by 2010 and 40 million new users in Indonesia.
