Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail.

The sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.

To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods.

The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.

The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop.
