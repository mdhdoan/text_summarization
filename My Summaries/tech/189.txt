Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail.

The sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.

The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.

To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods.

"In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users," he said, "but now we are going to go one step further."
