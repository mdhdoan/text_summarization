Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone.

Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices.

However, the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range.

A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.

Despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir.
