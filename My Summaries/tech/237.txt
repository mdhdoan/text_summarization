Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year.

Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.

Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.
