Indeed, it seems like there has been a CM game for as many years as there have been PCs.

With so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area.

With a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases.

Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager.

And if there are problems further down the line, Sports Interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible.
