Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager.

SI kept the game's code and database, and Eidos retained rights to the CM brand, and the look and feel of the game.

With so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area.

It has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans.

With a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases.
