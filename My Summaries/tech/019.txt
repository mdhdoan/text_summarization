Intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.

But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.

The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.

Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.

While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.
