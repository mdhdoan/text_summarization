At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing.

Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology.

He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items.

Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says.

The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini.
