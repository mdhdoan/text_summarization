P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.

Sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the IFPI reported this week.

Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.

The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.

Paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various DRM solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.
