Mr Trotter said Sony's combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs.

Conferring the award, PC Pro's staff picked out Sony's PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a "stunning piece of engineering".

"While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats," said Mr Trotter.

This year was the 10th anniversary of the PC Pro awards, which splits its prizes into two sections.

Paul Trotter, news and features editor of PC Pro, said several Sony products helped it to take the innovation award.
