He said Sony's Clie PEG UX50 media player with its swivel screen and qwerty keyboard "broke the design rules yet again".

"While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats," said Mr Trotter.

Microsoft's Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software.

Conferring the award, PC Pro's staff picked out Sony's PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a "stunning piece of engineering".

Mr Trotter said Sony's combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs.
