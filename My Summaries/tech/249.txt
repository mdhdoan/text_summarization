"This is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau," said Marco Behrmann, director of community relations at Mindark, the game's developer.

A 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (Â£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (RPG).

The land exists within the game Project Entropia, an RPG which allows thousands of players to interact with each other.

Ten PEDs are the equivalent to one US dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ($5) and shogun armour ($1.70) Gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating PEDs through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the Entropia universe.

"This type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming," said Deathifier.
