Digital cameras were the hot gadget of Christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $24bn last year.

Many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints.

Many people's hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular.

On Tuesday, Google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer's hard drive.

While many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer, other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information.
