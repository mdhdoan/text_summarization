For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun.

The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.

The game's drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on PC.

Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.

Both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along.
