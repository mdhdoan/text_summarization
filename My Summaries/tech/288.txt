For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun.

The game's drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on PC.

Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.

The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.

It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.
