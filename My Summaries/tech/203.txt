"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender," he said.

However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the Â£1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console.

This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK.

Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.

Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year.
