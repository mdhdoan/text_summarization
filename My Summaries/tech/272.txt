While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks.

"If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office, your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed - rather than something that should cause concern," said Graham Cluley, spokesman for anti-virus firm Sophos.

Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game.

At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines.

The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds.
