"He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image," said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project.

The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures.

Following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the TNO team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another Dutch city, with even higher resolution.

The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003.

"We had to rewrite almost all the tools," Me den Hartog told the BBC News website.
