"We had to rewrite almost all the tools," Me den Hartog told the BBC News website.

The Dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.

The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures.

"He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image," said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project.

The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003.
