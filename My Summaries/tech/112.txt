The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves.

Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release.

At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle.

Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.

Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version.
