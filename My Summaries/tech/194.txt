It is the first time Microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the BBC News website.

The first-time initiative is restricted to the UK and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November.

In June, the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP, Service Pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system.

"This is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of Windows XP software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders", said Alex Hilton, licence compliance manager at Microsoft.

Computer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones.
