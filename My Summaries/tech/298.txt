"Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services," said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service.

The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus.

The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service.

"Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?"

Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads.
