Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened.

In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations.

Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.

The number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months.

In its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals.
