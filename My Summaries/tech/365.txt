Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes.

The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria's online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC.

The channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on PCs.

The hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by Telekom Austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers.

In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.
