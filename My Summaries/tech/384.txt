As well as traditional broadcasting, Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media, like mobile services and online gaming.

Mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from China's 340 million mobile users.

Japan, South Korea and Singapore will also be strong players, but China's demographics give it the edge, a media conference in London heard.

News Corporation, Viacom and Sony Pictures are among the big names involved in joint ventures with Chinese players.

Online gaming sales are predicted to top a billion US dollars next year, according to the UK-based journal Screen Digest.
