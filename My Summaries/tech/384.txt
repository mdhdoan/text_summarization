As well as traditional broadcasting, Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media, like mobile services and online gaming.

Mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from China's 340 million mobile users.

News Corporation, Viacom and Sony Pictures are among the big names involved in joint ventures with Chinese players.
