Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query.

According to Pew Research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites.

Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden.

The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine.

A small number, 17%, said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist.
