Argonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the UK.

"A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time," he told BBC News Online.

The administrator told BBC News Online that the costs of restructuing would be too high, partly because of the overheads from the company's four premises across the UK.

Argonaut was behind the Harry Potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company.

Signs that it was in trouble emerged in August, when it warned it was heading for losses of Â£6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games.
