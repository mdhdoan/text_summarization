Argonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the UK.

Signs that it was in trouble emerged in August, when it warned it was heading for losses of Â£6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games.

Argonaut was behind the Harry Potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company.

The London-based company behind the Harry Potter games has sacked about 100 employees due to a severe cash crisis.

"A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time," he told BBC News Online.
