The .mobi domain would be aimed at websites and other services that work specifically around mobile phones, while the .jobs address could be used by companies wanting a dedicated site for job postings.

The application for .mobi was sponsored by technology firms including Nokia, Microsoft and T-Mobile.

The internet could soon have two new domain names, aimed at mobile services and the jobs market.

There are currently around 250 domain names in use around the globe, mostly for specific countries such as .fr for France and .uk for Britain.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) has given preliminary approval to two new addresses - .mobi and .jobs.
