The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated.

This new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population.

This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as Serbia, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey.

The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.

The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.
