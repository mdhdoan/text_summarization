A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers.

A "Fed-Ex refund processor" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home.

Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said.

"He's been successful ripping people off all these years," AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying.

Prosecutors said Jaynes was "a snake oil salesman in a new format", using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported.
