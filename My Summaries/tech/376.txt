The service, which has been developed with Southern trains, Nomad Digital (who provide the technology), begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April.

Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee Â£20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots.

It also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services, such as the UK's London to Brighton service, to provide commuters a fast net connection too.
