The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.

The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks.

Mr Yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals.

The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers.

Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security.
