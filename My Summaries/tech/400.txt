The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.

The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers.

Mr Yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals.

The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks.

The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats.
