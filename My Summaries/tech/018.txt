The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch.

The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media.

Special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game, Sony told an audience at the E3 exhibition in Los Angeles last year.

Details of the chip will be released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.

Sony has said the Cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games.
