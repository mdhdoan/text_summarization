Special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game, Sony told an audience at the E3 exhibition in Los Angeles last year.

The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch.

Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, will unveil the chip at a technology conference.

"In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network," said Ken Kutaragi, chief operating officer of Sony, said last year.

Details of the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be released in San Francisco on Monday.
