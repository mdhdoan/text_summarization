In early October a so-called "denial of service" attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs.

There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site.

Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack.

About the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic.

He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week.
