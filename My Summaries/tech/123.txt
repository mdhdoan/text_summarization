In early October a so-called "denial of service" attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs.

There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site.

He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week.

Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack.

The blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it.
