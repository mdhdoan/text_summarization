London-based software developer Connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the SMS functions of Skype, allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service.

It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing, voice mail and Skype In, a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles.

People using wireless net hotspots will soon be able to make free phone calls as well as surf the net.

Users of the system can also make calls to landlines and mobiles for a fee.

The system is gaining in popularity and now has 28 million users around the world.
