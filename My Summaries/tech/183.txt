"Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices," said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst.

Only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video.

The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two.

Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report.

Mr Fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device.
