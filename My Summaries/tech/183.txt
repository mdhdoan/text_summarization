"Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices," said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst.

The report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players.

The research revealed that French, 39%, and British, 31%, consumers were most interested in music players.

Now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every CD that they own.

Digital music players will be behind this market growth said Jupiter .
