Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order.

Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the UK.

"This is a preventative step we're choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents," said Robbie Bach, senior vice president, Microsoft home and entertainment division.

The company said the move was a "preventative step" after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables.

Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables.
