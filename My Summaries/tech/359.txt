This too crams a fully functional phone into a gadget that also plays games.

Although the device rolls together an impressive list of functions, it will face serious competition from three established names in mobile gaming: Nintendo, Nokia and Sony.

The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget goes on sale on Saturday.

A catalogue of about 20 games is being prepared for the gadget including The Great Escape and Conflict Vietnam.

It can be used to play games, music tracks and movies.
