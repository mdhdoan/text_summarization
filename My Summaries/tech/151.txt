Merriam-Webster said "blog" headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months.

Merriam-Webster defines a blog as: "a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks".

One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online.

Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about.

This is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny.
