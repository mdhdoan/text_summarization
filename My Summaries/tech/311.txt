The BBC News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing.

And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market.

A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology.

What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push.

Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics.
