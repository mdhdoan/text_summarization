"I needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg," Mr Tansley told the BBC News website.

The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.

"We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company," said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company.

The Motorsport Endeavour Club left the starting grid yesterday at the Autosport International 2005 show at Birmingham's NEC, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.

Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated.
