Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software.

"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected," Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement.

The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US.

Polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software.

Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas.
