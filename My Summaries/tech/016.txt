Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.

"I hope this day will focus people," Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.

Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions.

Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community.

The Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation.
