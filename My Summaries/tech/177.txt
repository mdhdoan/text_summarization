Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited.

Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.

Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years.

Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others.

The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software.
