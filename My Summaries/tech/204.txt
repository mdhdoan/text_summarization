People come to view resources which include the world's largest collection of patents and the UK's most extensive collection of science, technology and medical information.

"At the British Library we are continually exploring ways in which technology can help us to improve services to our users," said Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library.

"Surveys we conducted recently confirmed that, alongside the materials they consult here, our users want to be able to access the internet when they are at the Library for research or to communicate with colleagues," she said.

The Library receives between three and four million requests from remote users around the world each year.

Since May the service has registered 1,200 sessions per week, making it London's most active public hotspot.
