The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market.

The launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start.

The add-on for the DS means people can download TV programmes, film clips or MP3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move.

Nintendo is releasing an adapter for its DS handheld console so it can play music and video.

Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP.
