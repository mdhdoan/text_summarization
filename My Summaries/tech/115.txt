The technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.

The old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.

The software capable of doing this has been developed by a UK company, 2d3.

The Lifeplus project is part of the EU's Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage.

The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements.
