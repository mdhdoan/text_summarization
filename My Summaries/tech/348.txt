Some details of the Xbox's performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US.

This interface will hold details of a player's statistics and skill level on a "gamer card" as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess.

To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games.

He said gaming was entering a "high-definition" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear.

Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.
