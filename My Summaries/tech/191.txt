"At the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services," said Mr Davies.

Adopting an eBay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection.

E-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web.

There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of "cliques" talking to each other, he added.

With 53% of UK households now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or "middleman" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more "cosmopolitan politics" and public trust in policy.
