Once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem.

It spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups.

He said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks, often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.

The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack.

Mr Pollard said Arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected.
