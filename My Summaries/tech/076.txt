The first version of the service is part of Google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond.

"Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today," a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.

"We think TV is a big part of people's lives," said Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice president of product management.

The results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel, date and time.

It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function.
