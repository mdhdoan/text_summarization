"Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today," a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.

The first version of the service is part of Google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond.

Rival search engine Yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and TV clips which it promotes from its homepage.

"We think TV is a big part of people's lives," said Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice president of product management.

It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function.
