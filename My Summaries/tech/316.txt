More than 30,000 PCs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from Symantec showed last year.

In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics.

The number of women buying programs to protect PCs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004.

By the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access.

"You started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years," Paul Goosens, head of Preventon told the BBC News website.
