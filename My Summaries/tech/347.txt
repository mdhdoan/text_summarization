HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) has been described as "3G on steroids" and could offer consumers much faster download times.

Camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show, said Ben Wood, principal analyst at research firm Gartner.

Camera phones will get better resolutions as vendors set out to prove that bigger is definitely better.

Rainbow-coloured phones, influenced by handsets from Japan, are just one example of how Asian companies will stamp their mark on this year's show, at which they will have their biggest ever presence.

Korean giants LG Electronics and Samsung will show off HSDPA handsets at the show and the technology is set to be rolled out in the US, Europe and Korea next year.
