The portable version of the PlayStation has only just gone on sale in Japan yet some enterprising eBay users are selling the device to UK gadget fans.

About 85% of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their Christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group.

Iggy Fanlo, chief revenue officer at Shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping.

Many people are also using eBay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country.

According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site.
