"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory," Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website.

TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.

"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD.

"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console," he says.

"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming."
