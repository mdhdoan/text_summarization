She said in an official statement: "As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by Delta Airlines I am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the Federal Government EEOC [US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]."

Queen of the Sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the BBC News website and others.

A legal expert in the US speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted.

A US airline attendant suspended over "inappropriate images" on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired.

The blog, which she started in January as a way of getting over her mother's death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts.
