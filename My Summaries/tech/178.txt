"It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week," John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.com told BBC News.

The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

The Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year.

"Both have hit crucial price points at around Â£100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales," said Mr Houlihan.

The title broke the UK sales record for video games in its first weekend of release.
