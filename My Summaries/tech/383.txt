"We are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices," Jonas Guest, vice president for entertainment at Nokia, told the BBC News website.

But the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs.

Nokia and Microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets, while Sony Ericsson has unveiled its phone Walkman and Motorola is working on an iTunes phone.

You have to switch the PC on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music.

Mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival Apple's 60GB iPod.
