But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web.

Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton.

"Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way," she added.

Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google.

The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.
