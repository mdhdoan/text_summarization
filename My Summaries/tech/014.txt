Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software.But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement.Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs.The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.
