The BBC has already dipped its toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for PCs.

"HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes," says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US.

After years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan.

This is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits.

But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change.
