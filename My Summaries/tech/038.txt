The film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and DVDs already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses.

The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December.

As well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the US, the MPAA said it had given operators that host eDonkey servers "take down" notices.

The movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the US.

In October 2004, the site had provided links to more than 30,000 files.
