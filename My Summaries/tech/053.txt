But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves.

This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else.

The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.

Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003.

"The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market," he said.
