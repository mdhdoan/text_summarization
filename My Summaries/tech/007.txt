Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.

Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.

Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out.

Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month.
