For people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a Mac Mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.It is not the fastest computer for the money but for under Â£400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - Apple software.Of course, users of open source operating system Linux draw up their own menu of programs.But that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the Mac Mini to media centre uses.Another user has mounted his Mac Mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse.
