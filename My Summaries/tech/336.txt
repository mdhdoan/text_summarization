The Mac Mini comes bundled with Mac OS X, the operating system, as well as iLife 05, a suite of software which includes iTunes, web browser Safari, iPhoto, Garage Band and iDVD.

For people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a Mac Mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.

But for the value the Mac Mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, Apple is to be congratulated.

But that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the Mac Mini to media centre uses.

The Mac Mini was launched amid much fanfare by Apple and great excitement by Apple watchers last month.
