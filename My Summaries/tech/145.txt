The study by US researchers, Pew Internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing.

Through the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music.

Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found.

But the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the US.
