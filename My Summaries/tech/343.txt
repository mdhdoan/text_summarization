One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home.

Ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on Thursday when Intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year.

At the mobile phone conference 3GSM in Cannes last month Samsung demonstrated a phone using UWB technology from Freescale.

The first products using UWB technology from Intel are due to hit the market later this year.

UWB is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless USB devices which need low power consumption.
