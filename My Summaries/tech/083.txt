But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision.

Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.

Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of.

The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free.

Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site.
