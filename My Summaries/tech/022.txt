The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun.

Sun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun.

Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.

Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment.

So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software.
