There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on Firefox.

The announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco.

Microsoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.

The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser.

Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system.
