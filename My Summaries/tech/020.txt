One of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a Microsoft anti-spyware program.

The announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco.

In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004.

In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware.

Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals.
