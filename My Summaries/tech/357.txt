The detailed look at zombie or 'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the Honeynet Project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as "honey pots" to attract hackers and gather information about how they work.

Criminals also seem to be starting to use 'bot nets for mass identity theft, to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data.

Using a 'bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against.

The huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines.

Some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games.
