Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter.

The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services.

Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.

Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others.

More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common.
