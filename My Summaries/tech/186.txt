"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports," said the group in a statement.

It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports.

A net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information.

"It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue," said a Google spokesperson.

And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.
