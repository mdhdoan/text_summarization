Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.

It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports.

"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports," said the group in a statement.

The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information.

And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.
