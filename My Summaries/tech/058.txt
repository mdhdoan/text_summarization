Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram.

He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps.

Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month.

"Britain is now broadband Britain," said Duncan Ingram, BT's managing director, broadband and internet services.

In the last few months, many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services, including AOL, Plusnet and UK Online.
