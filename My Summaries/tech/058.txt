Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram.

He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps.

"These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections," he said.

The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL.

In the last few months, many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services, including AOL, Plusnet and UK Online.
