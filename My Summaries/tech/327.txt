"More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available, as new players enter the market, and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular," he added.

"IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project.

The ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership, the survey found.

A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans.

Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access.
