He was a student when he set up his napster.no site, which allowed users to submit and receive links to MP3 files.

Bruvik's site was online between August and November 2001, and while it did not host any music, at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers.

The website was not associated with the napster.com site in the USA, which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action.

As well as providing links, the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors.

A Norwegian court ruled in 2003 that Bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry, but the country's Court of Appeal cleared him, saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music.
