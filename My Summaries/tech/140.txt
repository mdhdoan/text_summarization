Philip Wride, who co-manages the Four-Kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 November to find the best eight players of the Painkiller game.

Said Mr Bysshe: "Painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up."

Four-Kings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the Painkiller game.

The CPL has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as Painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action.

Painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches, such as improved graphics, to the old-fashioned first-person shooter.
