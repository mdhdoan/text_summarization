Microsoft is planning to make Windows and Internet Explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information.

While Passport and Hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net, the latest system will store data on a user's PC.

Michael Stephenson, director in Microsoft's Windows Server division, would not confirm however whether the new info cards ID system will be built into the current Windows XP version or Longhorn.

Microsoft is developing a new version of Internet Explorer browser and its operating system, Windows, which has been code-named Longhorn.

Microsoft's two previous programs, Passport and Hailstorm, aimed to protect users but were criticised.
