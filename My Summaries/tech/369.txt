Microsoft is developing a new version of Internet Explorer browser and its operating system, Windows, which has been code-named Longhorn.

Microsoft is planning to make Windows and Internet Explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information.

Although the flaw was fixed, Microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in Internet Explorer.

Michael Stephenson, director in Microsoft's Windows Server division, would not confirm however whether the new info cards ID system will be built into the current Windows XP version or Longhorn.

Longhorn is due to be released commercially in late 2006, but an updated version of Internet Explorer is due for release later this year.
