A group of artists in Poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on Nintendo's handheld GameBoy console to a new level.

A GameBoy Advance costs about US $200 in Poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most Polish gamers, or musicians.

The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year.

"We have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like Commodore, Atari, Spectrum," he said.

The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed "blip-pop."
