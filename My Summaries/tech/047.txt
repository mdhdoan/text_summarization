The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband.

A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans.

"IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project.

"More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available, as new players enter the market, and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular," he added.

Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access.
