Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available.

The Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets.

Ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year.

"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people," said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels.

The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current Â£7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls.
