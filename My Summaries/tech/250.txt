Microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up Windows machines should be available within 30 days.

Following the takeover of anti-spyware firm Giant, Microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs.

At its most malign, spyware watches everything that people do with their PC and steals login information and other personal data.

Before now many of Microsoft's other security boosting programs, such as the firewall in Windows XP, have been given away free.

Surveys show that almost every Windows PC is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data.
