The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways.

It is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax.

Warrior Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.

That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game.

There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game.
