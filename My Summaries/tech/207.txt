They say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files, users should take more time to back-up and protect important files.

"Data can be recovered from computers, servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases," said Mr Palmer.

Mr Palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby's first three months on their computer, but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories.

"Data can disappear as a result of natural disaster, system fault or computer virus, but human error, including 'computer rage', seems to be a growing problem," said Adrian Palmer, managing director of Ontrack Data Recovery.

"However, individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis."
