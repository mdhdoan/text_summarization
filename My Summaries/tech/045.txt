Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox.

Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts.

The Xbox 2, high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006, it says.

That is Â£1,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable.

Sony's Playstation Portable is the top gadget for 2005, according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine.
