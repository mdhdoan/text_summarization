Computer users plug the device into a PC, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is.

Last year, the Office for National Statistics reported that for the first time, more than half of all households in Britain had a home computer.

"Using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem," said Karen Walsh, from the UK National Tremor Foundation.

The device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier.

The device uses similar "steady cam" technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements.
