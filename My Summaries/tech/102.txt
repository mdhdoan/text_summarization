"I was really shocked, I had no warning," Ms Simonetti told BBC News Online.

A large part of the blog contained fictional stories because Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti.

He speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of Ms Simonetti in uniform were posted.

Of the 10 or so images on the site, only one showed Ms Simonetti's flight "wings".

Ms Simonetti started her personal blog in January to help her get over her mother's death.
