"If you want to get impact from media you are running - either a movie, a game or watching TV - if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help."

"The technology has been around on PCs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone," said Mr Monteith.

Sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading.

Driving games and shoot 'em ups using the technology are in development.

British firm Sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3D audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers.
