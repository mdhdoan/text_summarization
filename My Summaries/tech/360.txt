Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs).

There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra.

It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats.

What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe.
