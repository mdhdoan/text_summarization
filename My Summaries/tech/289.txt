Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.

In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset.

Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.

The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked.

The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched.
