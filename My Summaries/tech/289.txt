In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset.

The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked.

Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.

For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK.

Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about Â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.
