The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video.

Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks.

More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more.

The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year.

A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold.
