Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks.

The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video.

Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as "super 3G", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services.

The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year.

More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more.
