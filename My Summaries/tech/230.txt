When interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home.

The posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an IR port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster.

"We started with infra-red because there are a huge number IR phones out there," said Rachel Harker, spokeswoman for Hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters.

Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips.

Sited at busy underground stations, the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset.
