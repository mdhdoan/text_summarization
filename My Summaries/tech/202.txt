John Underwood, the man behind the Live-Shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site.

The Live-Shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet.

For further fees, users can get the target they shot and a DVD recording of their session.

A year's work and $10,000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle.

Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals.
