The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture.

Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted.

The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann.

The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.

Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service.
