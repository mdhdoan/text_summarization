The huge amount of interest in Mr Beckham and his private life and the large number of messages posted to discussion groups on the net might mean that the malicious program catches a lot of people out.

The program that installs itself is called the Hackarmy trojan and it tries to recruit PCs into so-called 'bot networks that are often used to distribute spam mail messages or to launch attacks across the web.

But anyone visiting the website mentioned in the message will not see pictures of Mr Beckham but will have their computer infected by a virus.

But anyone visiting the website it mentions who then downloads and opens the fake image file stored on that site will be infected.

Tennis player Anna Kournikova, popstars Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger have all been used in the past to try to con people into opening infected files.
