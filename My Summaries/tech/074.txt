The report says that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.

This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China.

Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else.

Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes.

Net use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities.
