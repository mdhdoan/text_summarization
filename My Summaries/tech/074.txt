Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes.

The report says that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.

This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China.

The Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years, says a report.

Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008.
