The service includes WiFi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple PCs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house.

It is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband TV.

"The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services," said Mr Stening.

The service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge.

In South Korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a DVD and online gaming is huge.
