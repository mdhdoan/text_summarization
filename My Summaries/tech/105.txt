A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old.

"A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information," said project manager Livio Costantini.

The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m.

So far it has only received $11m from the US and the UK.

"The commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world," he said.
