A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old.

"A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information," said project manager Livio Costantini.

The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November, aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data, design blueprints of nuclear facilities, even satellite images of the plant.

The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m.

So far it has only received $11m from the US and the UK.
