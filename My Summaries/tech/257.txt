The worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 December produced only 1,440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message.

Security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpBB program.

In July a variant of the MyDoom virus slowed down searches on Google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to.

People using the sites hit by Santy will not be affected by the worm.

The worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program.
