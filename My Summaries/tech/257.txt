In July a variant of the MyDoom virus slowed down searches on Google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to.

The worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 December produced only 1,440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message.

Thousands of website bulletin boards have been defaced by a virus that used Google to spread across the net.

The worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program.

People using the sites hit by Santy will not be affected by the worm.
