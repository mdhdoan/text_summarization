Movies Open Water and Saw are among those to be made available for Sony's PSP games console.

"When we first saw the machine and started talking to Sony, we immediately decided it was going to be a winner, both from the gaming perspective and from the perspective of people watching movies on the go," Mr Beeks said.

Film studio Lions Gate entertainment has announced an initial list of 12 movies that will be on the UMD format used by the handheld.

The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sony's PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data.

Maybe they're already taking the games with them out of the house, and they're bigger gamers than they are movie watchers."
