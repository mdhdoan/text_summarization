Mr Molyneux has been behind many of the ground-breaking games of the last 15 years such as Populous, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper and Black and White.

The title gave players control over the lives a small population of computerised people.

Speaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise.

He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White.

One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film.
