"The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself," Mr Wong told the BBC News website.

Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.

Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a "colour memory" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision.

The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable.

Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally.
