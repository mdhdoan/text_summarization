At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine.

Rory Armes, studio general manager for games giant Electronic Arts (EA) in Europe, recently told the BBC News website in an interview that EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines.

Details of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May, according to reports.

Hit games like Halo 2, which was released in November, helped to buoy the sales figures.

Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months.
