Rory Armes, studio general manager for games giant Electronic Arts (EA) in Europe, recently told the BBC News website in an interview that EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines.

Details of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May, according to reports.

Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months.

Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo's kits.

But earlier this year, Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone, selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002.
