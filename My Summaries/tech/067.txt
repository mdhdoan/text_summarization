The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones.

The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.

Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.

"The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality," said Mr Flynn.

He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.
