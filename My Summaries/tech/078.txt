Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs.

Blogs, or web logs, are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts, opinions or spread news events in their own words.

Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign.

The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information, with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators.

Only 7% of the 120 million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary.
