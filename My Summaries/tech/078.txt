Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs.

The survey, conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year.

Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign.

Blogs, or web logs, are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts, opinions or spread news events in their own words.

Only 7% of the 120 million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary.
