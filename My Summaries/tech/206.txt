Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.

"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster," he told the BBC News website.

Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing.

Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading.

"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience," he said.
