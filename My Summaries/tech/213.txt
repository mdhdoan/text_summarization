What users do with Blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines.

Mr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before.

Ask Jeeves has added the ability to "save" websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found.

Some of the latest to update their search systems are Ask Jeeves and Blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web.

"The future is all about developing your own personal web," said Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves.
