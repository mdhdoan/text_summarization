The console (12cm by 7.4cm) will play games, movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming.

Sony has said it wanted to launch the PSP in Europe at roughly the same time as the US, but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back.

Sony is entering a market which has been dominated by Nintendo for many years.

It launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2.8 million units.

US gamers will be able to buy Sony's PlayStation Portable from 24 March, but there is no news of a Europe debut.
