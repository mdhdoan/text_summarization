PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes.

Sky Plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the UK, with 474,000 subscribers.

Cable firm Telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set -top box to challenge Sky Plus.

Last year, high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines.

A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited.
