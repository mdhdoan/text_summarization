Last year, high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines.

PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes.

A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited.

Eric Tveter, president and chief operating officer at Telewest Broadband, said: "We will make our PVR set-top box available later this year, putting a stop to missed soaps, interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record."

Sky Plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the UK, with 474,000 subscribers.
