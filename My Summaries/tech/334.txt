Users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.

But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency.

It is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer.

An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said.
