The portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of CES, which was the "time and place shifting" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time.

With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like Seagate's 5GB pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize.

Sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in March for the US and Europe.

Part of this has been the rise in spending power of the "generation X-ers" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them.

A Sony representative told the BBC News website this was because Sony did not consider it to be part of their "consumer technology" offering.
