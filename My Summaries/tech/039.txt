Users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.

But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency.

It is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer.

The message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use.

The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center.
