The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in.

"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites," he said.

To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals.

Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.

Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.
