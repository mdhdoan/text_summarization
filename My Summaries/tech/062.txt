"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites," he said.

Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.

Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world.

Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.

He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.
