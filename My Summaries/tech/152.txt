A mobile phone was as essential to the recent New Year's festivities as a party mood and Auld Lang Syne, if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by.

Anyone in need of a bit of January cheer now the party season is over, can use a service set up by Jongleurs comedy club, which will text them a joke a day.

For those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in, the Good Pub Guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub.

Wishing a Happy New Year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year's largest party.

Between midnight on 31 December and midnight on 1 January, 133m text messages were sent in the UK.
