Mac watchers and some analysts say the Mac mini will go a long way to help Apple appeal to the mass of consumers.

He thought that the machine would appeal to those that like Apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware.

Apple has traditionally done well in the market that the Mac mini is aimed at, said Mr Fogg, who also expected many PC makers to release copycat devices in reaction.

Apple expects the Mac mini to sell for Â£339 in the UK and $499 in the US.

Although the Mac mini was very cheap for an Apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many PCs.
