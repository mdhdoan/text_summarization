Apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the Mac mini win fans, he said.

The Mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said Mr Fogg.

The release of the Mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.

He thought that the machine would appeal to those that like Apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware.

Apple expects the Mac mini to sell for Â£339 in the UK and $499 in the US.
