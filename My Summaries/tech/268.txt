In the past, IBM has supported the non-commercial operating system Linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine Microsoft.

In a statement, Dr John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: "True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted.

IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports.

The move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for a licence from the company.

Stuart Cohen, chief executive of US firm Open Source Development Labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents.
