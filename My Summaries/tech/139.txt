Produced by Bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by Microsoft and became an Xbox exclusive.

It also capitalised on the growing popularity of LAN gaming in the PC world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.

The game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game.

When early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line.

"The first time I played it I just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun," said Errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game.
