BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.

The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection.

The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that, said Ms Rellie.
