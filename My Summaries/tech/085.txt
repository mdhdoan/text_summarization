BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.

Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures.

The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection.

She hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future.

ArtGarden, developed by BT's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings.
