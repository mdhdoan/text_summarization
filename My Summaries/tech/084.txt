The 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.

Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from £19 to £29.

Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March.

Nintendo raised its sales targets for the DS console last December after selling a million in the US and Japan in just a few weeks.

However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was "pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch".
