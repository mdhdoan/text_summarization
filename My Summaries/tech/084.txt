Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from £19 to £29.

The 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.

More than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said.

The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played.

"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger.
