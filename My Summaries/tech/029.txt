The war of words between Microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as Linux founder Linus Torvalds led an attack on software patents.

"The industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software," "We think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other," she added.

The attack on software patents comes at a time when IBM has made 500 of its patents freely available.

Linux is a freely-available alternative to Microsoft's Windows.

Mitchell Kapor, chairman of the Mozilla foundation, warned that Microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future.
