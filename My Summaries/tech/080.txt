The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters.

In December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software.

But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.

The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months.

Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies.
