Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes.

All the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see.

The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.

In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn.

The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.
