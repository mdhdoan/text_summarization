The US firm says it wants to compete with companies such as Disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences.

"You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it," he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.

He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims.

Jan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture.

EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each.
