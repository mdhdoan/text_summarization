People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages.

Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites.

Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.

In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them.

Lycos Europe's "Make love not spam" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes.
