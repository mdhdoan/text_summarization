People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages.

Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites.

Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.

Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites.

In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them.
