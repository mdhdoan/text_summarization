Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.

Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program.

Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software.

Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software.

The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.
