The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention".

In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.

This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service, for example.

Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.

This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court.
