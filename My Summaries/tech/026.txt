The PCs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program.

David Stanley, UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust, said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers.

But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place.

"If something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago," said Mr Hogan.

Once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers.
