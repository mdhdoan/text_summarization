It is not the first time Apple has sued people who have posted information about future products on the internet.

Computer firm Apple has issued a lawsuit to prevent online leaks of information about future products.

In a statement, Apple said of the current lawsuit: "Apple has filed a civil complaint against unnamed individuals who we believe stole our trade secrets and posted detailed information about an unannounced Apple product on the internet."

Apple is famously secretive about its future product launches while Apple users are equally famous for speculating about new technology from the company.

In December 2002, Apple sued a former contractor who allegedly posted online drawings, images and engineering details of the company's PowerMac G4 computer.
