The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first "successful" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac).

The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980.

Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now.

The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.

The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.
