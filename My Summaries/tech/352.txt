Wanadoo is set to trial an 8Mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services - which means it takes over the network from BT - which will provide speeds of up to 15Mbps.

Cable firms ntl and Telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and, according to an ntl spokesman, are in a better position than BT in the long term.

Faster broadband in the UK is becoming a reality as more internet providers offer super-fast services.

For BT Retail, she said, the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players.

Others will be watching BT Retail's trials, which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers, with interest.
