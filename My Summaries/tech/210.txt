He said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims.

The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003.

The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction.

Like many other recent viruses, Bofra plunders the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses.

Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus.
