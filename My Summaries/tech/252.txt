Security firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.

On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus.

Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.

The virus' subject line says "Merry Christmas" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to.

To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug.
