At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Microsoft boss Bill Gates said Xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle.

In the first year at least, developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines.

Sony is thought to have a similar vision for PS3 while Nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games.

Gerhard Florin, head of EA in Europe, said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games.

While short on detail, he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a PC and offer "great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people, more communications, more media, more connectivity".
