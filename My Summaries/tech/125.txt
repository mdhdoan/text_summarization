It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation 2, the game's graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version.

The sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for.

It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars, it would not stand up for long.

There are also odd annoyances, like the game's insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear.

Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game.
