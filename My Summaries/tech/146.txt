The ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time.

"Year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how Europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for TV, newspaper and radio," said Jupiter Research analyst Olivier Beauvillian.

The threat to TV was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the UK, France and Spain, said the report.

The report by Nielsen/NetRatings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year.

The number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits, research suggests.
