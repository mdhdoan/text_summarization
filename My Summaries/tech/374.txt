Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players.

In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.

Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run.

It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games.

In the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.
