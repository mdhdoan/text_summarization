In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages.

The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help.

"In every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages."

"You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away," he said, "That's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy."

He added: "Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places."
