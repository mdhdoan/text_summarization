Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT.

Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests.

"Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it," said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT.

The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain.

By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.
