The research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.

"When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them," said Dr Bowden.

Literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.

"Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on."

Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos.
