In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds.

According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile.

Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6,000 people in the UK, US, Germany and South Korea for the survey.

Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the "cosiness" of making a call there.

The Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes.
