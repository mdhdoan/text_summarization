The expert panel probed the future of P2P at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier in January.

Legal music download services, like Apple iTunes, Napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content.

Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.

P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.
