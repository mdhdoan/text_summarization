"In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming," she said.

In countries such as Korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular.

But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin.

"ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games," he added.

One of the main factors that spoils online gaming is "lag" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world.
