The handheld console can play games, music and movies and goes on sale in Europe and North America next year.

Gamers have bought almost all of the first batch of Sony's new PlayStation Portable (PSP) games console, which went on sale in Japan on Sunday.

Nintendo released its new DS console earlier this year and has already raised shipment targets for the device by 40%.

The PSP is selling in Japan for 19,800 yen ($188; £98) while Nintendo's DS console sells in the US and Japan for $150 (£78).

Despite the demand Sony said it would not increase the 500,000-strong stock of PSPs it plans to ship by year's end.
