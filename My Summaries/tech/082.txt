That figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the BBC News website - Codemasters, Climax and Rebellion.

"As consoles get more powerful, the content gets more detailed and that means more cost," said Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, which develops games in house and also publishes titles.

"There are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days.

"Some of them are still making games for peer group approval - that has to stop."

Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months.
