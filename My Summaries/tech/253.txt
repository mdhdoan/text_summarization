"As such, it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition, when the record was 426m per minute, or 25.6 km/h, less than half the speed of the new record," said Hein Le Roux, specialist researcher at the Guinness World Records.

The key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include:

In total, the TFC Tower has 61 lifts, 34 of them double-deckers, and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors.

The first record for the world's fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the Guinness Book of Records in 1955.

Two high-speed lifts at the world's tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet's fastest.
