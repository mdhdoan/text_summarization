Mr Jobs also unveiled the iPod shuffle, a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives, which are used in more expensive iPods.

Mr Jobs told the delegates at MacWorld that iPod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players.

The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled.

Ian Harris, deputy editor of UK magazine Mac Format, said the machine would appeal to PC-owning consumers who had purchased an iPod.

In January, Apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer.
