"Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently," said Mr Voigt.

From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data.

Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times.

Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.
