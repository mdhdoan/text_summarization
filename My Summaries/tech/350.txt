"Voice-over broadband is a key trend across Europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry, " Eric Abensur, Wanadoo's chief executive told the BBC News website.

US firm Vonage also offers a Voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls.

The world's largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently.

Subscribers to Wanadoo's broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any UK landline, and free calls at any time to other Wanadoo users.

Almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the Skype Voip service, according to the net telephony firm's website.
