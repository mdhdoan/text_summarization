The firm is following in the footsteps of Microsoft, Google and Ask Jeeves, which have offered similar services.

Internet giant Yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their PCs.

"It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well," he said.

Alexander Linden, vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm Gartner,downloaded the Google product but has since removed it.

It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data.
