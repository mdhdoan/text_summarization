The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.

The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.

"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat," said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list.

Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.

The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.
