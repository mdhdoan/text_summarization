If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website.

The AutoLink feature comes with Google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book's ISBN number on the site.

Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company.

Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.

Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any "click through" to a commercial site.
