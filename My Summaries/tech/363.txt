The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget also went on sale in the UK last week.

The entertainment device, which also stores images, music and video, is intended to compete with Nintendo's DS, released earlier this month in the UK.

The latest handheld gaming gadget, Sony's PlayStation Portable, goes on sale in the US on Thursday.
