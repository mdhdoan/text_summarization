Through the Make Love, Not Spam website, users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages.

"The idea was simply to slow spammers' sites and this was achieved by the campaign," the company said.

The company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites.

A contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped.

Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action.
