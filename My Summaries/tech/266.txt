But poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish.

The game has also tried to emulate franchises such as Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS2 and so there are a number of combat elements.

But the game's excellent graphics, easily the best-looking platform game around, sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans.

As the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters.

The character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.
