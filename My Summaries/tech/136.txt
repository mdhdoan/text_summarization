"Broadband and telephony are attractive to customers and BT wants to make sure it is in the first wave of services," said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.

"People already using BT Communicator have found it by far the most convenient way of making a call if they are at their PC," said Andrew Burke, director of value-added services at BT Retail.

The offer will be limited to the first 50,000 people who sign up and there are limitations - the free calls do not include calls to mobiles, non-geographical numbers such as 0870, premium numbers or international numbers.

Reports say that BT has lost around 10% of market share over the last year, down from half of broadband users to less than 40%.

Users will need to use BT's internet telephony software, known as BT Communicator, and have a microphone and speakers or headset on their PC.
