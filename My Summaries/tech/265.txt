Figures from industry monitor, the Mobile Data Association (MDA), show the number of phones with GPRS and MMS technology has doubled since last year.

About 53 million people own a mobile in the UK, so the figures mean that half of those phones use GPRS.

Mobile companies are keen for people to use multimedia functions their phones, like sending MMS and going online, as this generates more money for them.

With more services being offered by mobile operators, people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile.

By the end of 2005, the MDA predicts that 75% of all mobiles in the UK will be able to access the net via GPRS.
