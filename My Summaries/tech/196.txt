"It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer to Mozilla's new Firefox browser," said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com.

The proportion of surfers using Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) has dropped to below 90%, say web analysts.

"Microsoft continues to make significant investments in IE, including Service Pack 2 with advanced security technologies, and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for Internet Explorer."

Other browser software, like Opera and Apple's Safari, are also challenging Microsoft's grip on the browser market.

That means people are free to adapt the software's core code to create other innovative features, like add-ons or extensions to the program.
