Many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net.

Apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the Tiger operating system.

Microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals, many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users.

The program could be based on the software Microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of Lookout Software in early October.

Companies such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.
