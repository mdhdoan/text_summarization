The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming.

The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again.

The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone.

The program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.

Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless.
