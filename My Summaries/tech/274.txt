Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK's top players of the PC game.

"There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport," said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel.

As part of their prize the pair also get a contract with Four-Kings Intel which is one of the UK's few pro-gaming teams.

"Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity," he said.

Aaron Foster and David Treacy have won the right to take part in a tournament offering $1m in total prize money.
