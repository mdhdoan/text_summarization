A new version of iTunes is now available from the Apple website which solves the problem.

Users of Apple's music jukebox iTunes need to update the software to avoid a potential security threat.

The problem affects all users of iTunes - Windows and Mac OS - running versions 4.7 and earlier.

Users can automatically upgrade iTunes by opening the "look for updates" window in the program.

Hackers can build malicious playlist files which could crash the program and let them seize control of the computer by inserting Trojan code.
