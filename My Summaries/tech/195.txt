Valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts.

Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the 20,000 represented.

Game maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.

"It's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games," he said.
