Game maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.

If Steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said Mr Fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems.

Valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts.

Before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played.

Some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of Valve's anti-piracy actions.
