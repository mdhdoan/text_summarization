All attempts by the BBC News website to contact the people behind the site have failed.

The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage.

She said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered.

Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information.

Patricia Sanders, spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down.
