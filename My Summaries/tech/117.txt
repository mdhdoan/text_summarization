Anti-virus firms are issuing high-level warnings about the new version of the Bagle e-mail program that seems to be catching a lot of people out.

Anti-virus firms urged users to be wary of unexpected e-mail messages bearing attachments and to update their software to ensure they are protected against the latest threats.

Security firm Network Box said that it stopped more than 30,000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached a peak.

The Windows virus grabs e-mail addresses from Microsoft Outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims.

"We've had several reports all over the world," said Mikko Hypponen, director of anti-virus research for F-Secure.
