"The game is theirs to lose and MSN is the only one that stands in the way of Yahoo's domination," predicted Mr Weiner.

Search will be a key focus as will making Yahoo Messenger available on mobiles, forging new broadband partnerships such as that with BT in the UK and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop, he says.

"Search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content," he said.
