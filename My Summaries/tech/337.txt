Search will be a key focus as will making Yahoo Messenger available on mobiles, forging new broadband partnerships such as that with BT in the UK and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop, he says.

But for Allen Weiner, a research director at analyst firm Gartner and someone who has followed Yahoo's progress since the early years, the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it.

In recent years, the column inches have stacked up in Google's favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as Gmail, its shopping channel Froogle and Google News.

"Search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content," he said.

"The game is theirs to lose and MSN is the only one that stands in the way of Yahoo's domination," predicted Mr Weiner.
