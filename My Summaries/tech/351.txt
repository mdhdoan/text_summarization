Part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld.

Sony's PSP represents a real threat to Nintendo because of the huge number of PlayStation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget.

"We know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day," said Robert Quinn, Game's UK sales director.

The PSP uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play.

Since going on sale in Japan and the US at the end of 2004, Nintendo has sold almost 4m DS consoles.
