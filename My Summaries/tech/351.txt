"We know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day," said Robert Quinn, Game's UK sales director.

Part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld.

The PSP uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play.

Five Virgin megastores and 150 Game shops were expected to open early on Friday morning to let people buy a DS.

A "download play" option means DS owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game.
