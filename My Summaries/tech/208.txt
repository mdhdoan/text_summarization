Already on US photojournal site, Buzznet, there is a public album full of snaps of celebrities, many of which were taken with camera phones.

But this is not just about traditional media lending immediacy to their stories with content from ordinary people, it is also about first-hand journalism in the form of online diaries or weblogs.

One day later De Telegraaf, a daily Amsterdam newspaper, became news on its own when it published a picture taken with a mobile phone of Mr van Gogh's body moments after he was killed.

Tabloid newspapers in the UK and many monthly magazines invite readers to send in images of famous people they have seen and snapped.

It could be the start of a trend that only increases as higher resolution phone cameras become more widespread; as video phones catch on and millions of people start carrying the gadgets around.
