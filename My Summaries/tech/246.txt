The Japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new, improved Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) can now run, find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people.

Its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as Sony's Qrio, which became the first robot to run last year.

Technology developed for Asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design.

"The aim is to develop a robot that can help people in their daily lives," said a Honda spokesman.

He is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances.
