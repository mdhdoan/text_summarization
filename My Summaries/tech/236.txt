"We hope that Oxford's contribution to this project will be of scholarly use, as well as general interest, to people around the world," said Reg Carr, director of Oxford University Library Services.

"The goal of the project is to unlock the wealth of information that is offline and bring it online," said Susan Wojcicki, director of product management at Google.

Online pages from scanned books will not have adverts but will have links to online store Amazon, Google said.

Users will only have access to extracts and bibliographies of copyrighted works.

The libraries of five of the world's most important academic institutions are to be digitised by Google.
