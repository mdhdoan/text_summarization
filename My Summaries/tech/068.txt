After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers.

However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.

But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer.

He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking.

The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use.
