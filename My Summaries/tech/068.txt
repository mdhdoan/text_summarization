After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers.

However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.

Mr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department.

But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer.

Mr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released.
