Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF.

"It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site," he added.

The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'.

But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.
