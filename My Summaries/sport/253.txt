Both players will miss this weekend's games when Celtic host Dundee United and Rangers visit Kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal.

Meanwhile, Bob Malcolm and Rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to Rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game.

An SFA spokesman said: "They have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before Friday.

That means Novo will miss a further two games because of his prior record.

"But what I will say is that I'm at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game."
