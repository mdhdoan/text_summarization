Both players will miss this weekend's games when Celtic host Dundee United and Rangers visit Kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal.

An SFA spokesman said: "They have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before Friday.

Meanwhile, Bob Malcolm and Rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to Rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game.

I don't know if there's a lot to add to that," said Rangers manager Alex McLeish of Novo's punishment.

The additional bans come into effect from 28 December meaning Camara will also be unavailable for the home game against Livingston while Novo will miss the meetings with Dundee United and Dunfermline.
