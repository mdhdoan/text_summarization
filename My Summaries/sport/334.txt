England have named Bath prop Matt Stevens in the starting line-up for their Six Nations match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Sunday.

England confirmed that Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan was not considered for selection because of an injury he picked up to the back of his ankle during last Friday's match against Leeds.

It will be Stevens' first start after two caps as a replacement against the All Blacks last year.

Fellow Bath prop Duncan Bell will start on the bench, as coach Andy Robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by France.

"All three players have shown outstanding form of late, most recently in the England A win against France A and for their club," added Robinson.
