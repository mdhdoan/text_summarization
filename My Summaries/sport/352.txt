Former captain Keith Wood believes Ireland can win only their second Grand Slam - and first since 1948 - in this year's RBS Six Nations Championship.

Wood - Ireland can win Grand Slam

"There is a great chance to win a Grand Slam.

"Things have been building up over the past few years and I think this is the year for Ireland," he told BBC Sport.

"Wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams."
