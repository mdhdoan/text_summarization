"The injury is more common in Australian Rules football, and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although Mark's injury is slightly different."

Mark Philippoussis is almost certain to miss the Australian Open after suffering a groin injury during the Hopman Cup loss to the Netherlands.

He played one more game, but his movement was hampered and he quit.

"It would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once, let alone two days in a row, inside two weeks.

He is now unlikely to be fit in time for the Australian Open which begins on 17 January in Melbourne.
