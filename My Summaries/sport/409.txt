Ireland and Munster lock Paul O'Connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.

"They could so easily have been coming to Dublin with two wins and staring a Grand Slam in the face as well."

"I have spoken to Sir Clive Woodward a few times, but not for very long, certainly nothing about summer holidays," he joked.

O'Connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job, but says he is totally focused on Sunday's Six Nations crunch clash with England.

"I honestly don't think about these reports," he told BBC Sport.
