The world number one will play Cypriot

Hrbaty defeated the 10th seed 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-3 in a match lasting four hours and 21 minutes.

Ancic, Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push Safin all the way when he took the second set but Safin raised his game to sink the Croatian.

Having secured the lead, Agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks.

But he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes.
