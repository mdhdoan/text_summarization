Ancic, Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push Safin all the way when he took the second set but Safin raised his game to sink the Croatian.

Having secured the lead, Agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks.

Hrbaty defeated the 10th seed 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-3 in a match lasting four hours and 21 minutes.

But he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes.

Andre Agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the Australian Open with victory over Taylor Dent.
