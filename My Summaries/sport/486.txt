Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.

The Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion.

He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.

After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness.

After 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break.
