Speaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told BBC Sport: "Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved.

"We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship."

LTA chief executive, John Crowther, added: "The relationship that Jimmy's already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we'd like some more of it.

"He worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he'll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them.

"La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best," said Connors, speaking at Queen's Club in London.
