Speaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told BBC Sport: "Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved.

Former world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.

LTA chief executive, John Crowther, added: "The relationship that Jimmy's already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we'd like some more of it.

"He worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he'll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them.

"We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship."
