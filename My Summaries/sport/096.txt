But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early.

He has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February.

Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may make his comeback after an Achilles tendon injury in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday.

But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals.

Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday.
