O'Neill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury.

Bulgaria's game comes between Celtic's Boxing Day meeting with Hearts and their 2 January fixture against Livingston.

"When we were out playing Barcelona, I spoke with the Bulgarian manager, Hristo Stoichkov, and he mentioned this game to me.

"I have said this before, but Bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games."

"They have organised a game at a rather awkward time," he added.
