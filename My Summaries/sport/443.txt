Tennis star Kim Clijsters will make her return from a career-threatening injury at the Antwerp WTA event in February.

Back then, a doctor treating the Belgian feared that her career may be over, with the player having already endured an operation earlier in the season to cure her wrist problem.

"Kim had considered returning to action in Paris on 7 February," a statement on her website said.

The 21-year-old has not played since last October after aggravating a wrist injury at the Belgian Open.

Clijsters was also due to marry fellow tennis star Lleyton Hewitt in February but the pair split "for private reasons" back in October.
