Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side.

"Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried."

Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match.

Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance.

"If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team," he said.
