Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side.

"Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried."

Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match.

"They're on a high, but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win," he said.

"If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team," he said.
