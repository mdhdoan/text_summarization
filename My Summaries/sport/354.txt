A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen's led the team to a clean sweep in 1948.

He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year.

However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight.

With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed.
