Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time.

United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval.

United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar.

United restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half.

But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match.
