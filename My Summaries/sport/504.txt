Conchita Martinez won her first title in almost five years with victory over Anna-Lena Groenefeld at the Volvo Women's Open in Pattaya, Thailand.

Groenefeld was the more powerful player but could not match her opponent's relentless accuracy.

"It feels really good," said Martinez, who is playing her last season on the Tour.

"I think she played a good match, a tough match, but I tried to stay in there.

"It's been nearly five years and I didn't think I could do it."
