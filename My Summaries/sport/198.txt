Arsenal's Edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed Manchester United's win over the Gunners.

But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of United's challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes.

It also charged Ruud van Nistelrooy with serious foul play while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee.

"The United players were trying to wind us up about the result but I didn't see any soup being thrown at anyone."

The Brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.
