The United States kept the Davis Cup final alive with victory in Saturday's doubles rubber, leaving Spain 2-1 ahead going into the final day.

The 26-year-old Bryan twins have won all four of their Davis Cup matches this year.

He was replaced by former world number one Ferrero, but the Spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world's best doubles teams.

Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over Roddick on Friday.

When Robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over, and the unflappable Bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win.
