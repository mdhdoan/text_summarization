France coach Bernard Laporte believes his team will be scared going into their game with England on Sunday, but claims it will work in their favour.

"Playing with the France team has always been a dream and now it has come true and I am about to face England at Twickenham in the Six Nations."

The French turned in a stuttering performance as they limped to a 16-9 win against Scotland in the opening match of the Six Nations on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Perpignan centre Jean-Philippe Granclaude is delighted to have received his first call-up to the France squad.

Fear will help France - Laporte
