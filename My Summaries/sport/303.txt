Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this year's Six Nations.

Wales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.

Jones was happy to hail Henson's heroic contribution to Wales' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993.

Jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before Charlie Hodgson put England in front with 10 minutes left.

Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff.
