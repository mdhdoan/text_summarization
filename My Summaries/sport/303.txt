Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this year's Six Nations.

Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff.

Jones was happy to hail Henson's heroic contribution to Wales' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993.

But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff.

Wales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.
