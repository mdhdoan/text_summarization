American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2.

Before her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game.

Australian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia's Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4.

World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed.

"I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle," she said.
