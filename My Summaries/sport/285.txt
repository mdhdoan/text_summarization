England, fourth in the Six Nations table with zero points, play Ireland, top of the table, in Dublin on 27 February, kick-off 1500 GMT.

Barkley will have a scan on Sunday and might miss England's trip to Six Nations leaders Ireland next weekend.

The news is just the latest blow for coach Andy Robinson, who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the 2005 Six Nations.

Robinson could choose to recall Mathew Tait or Henry Paul, although Tait endured a nightmare for Newcastle against Leicester on Saturday and Paul limped off with an ankle injury against Bath.

Bath prop Matt Stevens is the only remaining tight-head in England's training squad and could be involved against Ireland.
