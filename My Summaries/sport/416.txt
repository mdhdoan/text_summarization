Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try.

Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes.

Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.

Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.

Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.
