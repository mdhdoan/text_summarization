European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen's boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining.

Lawrence Dallaglio's team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz.

The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed.

The Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry.

However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight.
