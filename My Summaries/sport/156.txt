Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is lining up a summer move for England and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen.

"I'm after three, four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets," he said.

The former Rangers and Liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed.

Souness has also hinted he thinks Shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season.

The Peruvian international was sold to Aston Villa a year ago but in the phone-in for BBC Newcastle, Souness said tried to re-sign him, but Villa were not interested in selling.
