The referee from Saturday's France v Scotland Six Nations match has defended the officials' handling of the game after criticism by Matt Williams.

The Scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials.

Nonetheless, he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side a famous victory.

"Ultimately there is a match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials.

But Nigel Williams said: "I'm satisfied the game was handled correctly."
