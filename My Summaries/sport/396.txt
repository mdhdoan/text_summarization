Rhys Williams says Wales are still not thinking of winning the Grand Slam despite a third Six Nations win.

Wales silent on Grand Slam talk

"We've come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we'll worry about Ireland hopefully after we've beaten Scotland."

"That's the last thing on our minds at the moment," said Williams, a second- half replacement in Saturday's 24-18 win over France in Paris.

Scotland secured their first win of the campaign on Saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over Italy.
