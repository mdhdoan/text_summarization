Italy coach John Kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing Ireland close when they meet Wales on Saturday.

"Our goal is to match every side we face and against Ireland we showed we could do that," said Kirwan.

"But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play Wales on Saturday."

He had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence.

Despite losing 28-17 in Sunday's Six Nations encounter, the Italians confirmed their continuing improvement.
