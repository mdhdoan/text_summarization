- Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson: "It was a fantastic performance by us.

Wayne Rooney made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter-finals.

Rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by Martyn in injury-time when he outpaced Stubbs, but once again Martyn denied the England striker.

Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith.

United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time.
