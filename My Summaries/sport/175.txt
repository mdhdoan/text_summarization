Beattie was suspended for the win at Aston Villa after his red card against Chelsea and he will be available again for the Merseyside derby at Liverpool on 20 March.

Everton striker James Beattie has been declared fit for training on Tuesday, despite suffering an alleged assault last Saturday.

He was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following Everton's 3-1 win over Aston Villa.

Beattie, 27, is not believed to be as seriously hurt as some reports have suggested after being "the victim of an unprovoked assault" in Birmingham.

"He has spoken to manager David Moyes about what happened."
