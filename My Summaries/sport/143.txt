Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer.

The club's managing director, Keith Edelman, stressed that the development of their new Â£350m stadium had no affect on Wenger's spending power.

"It's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place, before we began on the stadium."

"Its great to have nice, new surroundings, but if the team aren't performing on the pitch, then there isn't great respect in having a fabulous stadium," he said.

"Hopefully, we'll spend it this summer and in the coming years.
