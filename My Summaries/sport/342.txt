Robinson, stand-in captain in the absence of Jonny Wilkinson, had been due to lead England in their final two games against Italy and Scotland.

Robinson said: "This is very disappointing for me as this means I miss England's last two games in the Six Nations at Twickenham and two games for my club, Sale Sharks.

England will announce their squad for the 12 March game against Italy on Saturday.

England captain Jason Robinson will miss the rest of the Six Nations because of injury.

Robinson picked up the injury in the 19-13 defeat to Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Saturday.
