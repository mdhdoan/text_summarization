Assistant coach Martin Jol has been put in temporary charge and will take care of team affairs for Saturday's Premiership match against Charlton.

The former France manager moved to White Hart Lane this summer but now wants to return to France.

"Our priority is to ensure that this season's performance remains unaffected by this move.

Arnesen said the club were sad to see Santini go: "We are obviously disappointed that Jacques is leaving us.

I very much hope that the wonderful fans will respect my decision."
