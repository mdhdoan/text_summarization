Wales coach Mike Ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday's trip to France.

"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right," said Ruddock.

Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994.

"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week."
