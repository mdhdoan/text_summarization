Referred to in the Netherlands as "the General", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany.

Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football.

However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final.

The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch.

The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen.
