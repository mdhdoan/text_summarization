Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football.

However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final.

The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen.

His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world.

Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971.
