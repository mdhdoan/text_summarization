Arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before Tottenham's Premiership fixture with Charlton.

"I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini," Stevens told Five Live.

But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals.

Tottenham sporting director Frank Arnesen has denied that coach Jacques Santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at White Hart Lane.

Arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused Santini to quit after just 13 games in charge.
