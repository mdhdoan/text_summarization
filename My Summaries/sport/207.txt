"It is absolutely not true," Arnesen told BBC Radio Five Live.

However, former Spurs and England defender Gary Stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift.

"I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini," Stevens told Five Live.

Tottenham sporting director Frank Arnesen has denied that coach Jacques Santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at White Hart Lane.

But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals.
