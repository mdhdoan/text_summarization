Four British athletes have been pre-selected to compete at the World Cross Country Championships in March after impressive starts to the season.

Keska, who has made a successful return from a long-term injury lay-off, contests the men's 12km race on 20 March, while 16-year-old Hickey goes in the junior men's 8km on the same day.

The 32-year-old will race alongside Olympic 5,000m finalist Pavey in the women's 8km race on 19 March.

Hayley Yelling, Jo Pavey, Karl Keska and Adam Hickey will represent Team GB at the event in France.

Keska helped the men's team to overall third place while Hickey finished in 10th place on his junior debut.
