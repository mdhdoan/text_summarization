Jade Johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid despite winning the AAAs long jump title on Saturday.

And the Commonwealth and European silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence.

Johnson, who finished seventh in last year's Olympic Games, has not competed indoors since 2000.

"I will have to see how I am jumping in the next competition and I'll have to have a conversation with my coach."

Johnson next competes in the high-class Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February.
