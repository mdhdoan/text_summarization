Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.

Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg.

He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August.

Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time.

But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals.
