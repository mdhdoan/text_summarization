The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday's Norwich Union Grand Prix.

The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds.

Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.

Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg.

He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August.
