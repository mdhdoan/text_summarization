In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka.

Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal.

In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him.

Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.

A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance.
