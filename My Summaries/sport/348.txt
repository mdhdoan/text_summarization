Ruddock praised Owen's contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year's wins over England, Italy and France, notably his role in the second-half in Paris following Thomas' injury.

Owen admitted the Grand Slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one was getting carried away with the three victories over England, Italy and France.

Wales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales' captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad.

"You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country," he said.

"It's an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour."
