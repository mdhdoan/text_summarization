Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban.

Not only that, but a fair majority of the present Ireland side will be wearing red next June in New Zealand.

But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high.

But the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf.

The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider.
