Carroll has stepped up his form in recent weeks and in late January scored an impressive 3,000m victory over leading American Alan Webb in Boston.

Carroll will be facing stiff competition from Australian Craig Mottram, winner in Dublin for the last two years.

"I understand she's had a solid winter's training down in Australia after recovering from a minor injury," said race director Matthew Turnbull.

Sonia O'Sullivan will seek to regain her title at the Bupa Great Ireland Run on 9 April in Dublin.

Mark Carroll, Irish record holder at 3km, 5km and 10km, will make his debut in the mass participation 10km race.
