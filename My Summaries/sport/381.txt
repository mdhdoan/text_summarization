Having beaten Australia and South Africa to reach the final, England fell behind to an early try against Fiji.

England beat Fiji 26-21 in a dramatic final in Dubai to win the first IRB Sevens event of the season.

"To be honest, England have wanted to win in Dubai for a very long time now, and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long," said Friday.

Mike Friday's England side matched their opponents for pace, power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time.

Portugal confirmed their impressive progress in Sevens rugby by recording a sudden-death win over France in the bowl final.
