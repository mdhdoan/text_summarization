Having beaten Australia and South Africa to reach the final, England fell behind to an early try against Fiji.

"To be honest, England have wanted to win in Dubai for a very long time now, and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long," said Friday.

England beat Fiji 26-21 in a dramatic final in Dubai to win the first IRB Sevens event of the season.

Mike Friday's England side matched their opponents for pace, power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time.

But Neumi Nanuku and Marika Vakacegu touched down for Fiji, only for a needless trip by Tuidriva Bainivalu on Geoff Appleford to allow England to run down the clock.
