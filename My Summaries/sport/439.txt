Mirza, the first Indian woman to win a WTA Tour title this month on home ground at Hyderabad, will now face US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.

Former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez and India's Sania Mirza, the oldest and youngest players in the draw, also reached the second round.

Venus Williams suffered a first-round defeat for the first time in four years at the Dubai Championships.

"The first time I served again was Sunday and there wasn't a lot I could do out there.

Williams though blamed her defeat by Farina Elia on injuries.
