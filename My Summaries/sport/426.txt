Agassi has won the San Jose five times, but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to Mardy Fish in the semi-finals.

Young, who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14, was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games.

Second seed Andre Agassi opens his campaign on Tuesday against wildcard Bobby Reynolds, last year's US collegiate champion.

Top seed Andy Roddick launches his defence of the title on Wednesday against qualifier Paul Goldstein.

Young shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys' singles at January's Australian Open.
