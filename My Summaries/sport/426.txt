Top seed Andy Roddick launches his defence of the title on Wednesday against qualifier Paul Goldstein.

Young, who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14, was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games.

Agassi has won the San Jose five times, but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to Mardy Fish in the semi-finals.

And Ginepri - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.

Second seed Andre Agassi opens his campaign on Tuesday against wildcard Bobby Reynolds, last year's US collegiate champion.
