Moya, Spain's Davis Cup final hero in their recent win over the US, had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final.

Tournament director Craig Watson said: "I had a message relayed to me from him after Spain's Davis Cup victory, saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the (2004) final.

In the men's event, world number three Lleyton Hewitt returns to defend his title, along with runner-up Carlos Moya.

Women's world number one Lindsay Davenport and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will also compete.

The Belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the US Open in September, where she was beaten in the fourth round by Nadia Petrova.
