Speaking at an elite coaches' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards.

"At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain," the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live.

Johnson was involved in a verbal spat with Britain's Darren Campbell earlier this year.

Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.

"The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other," he claimed.
