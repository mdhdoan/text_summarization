Liverpool's win means all four of England's Champions League representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time.

Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval.

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was "one of the proudest nights of my career."

"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans.

"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances.
