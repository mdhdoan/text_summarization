Liverpool's win means all four of England's Champions League representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time.

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was "one of the proudest nights of my career."

Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time.

Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval.

"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances.
