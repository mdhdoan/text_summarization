But boss McClaren is looking for a victory which would mean they avoid a team that has played in the Champions League in Friday's third-round draw.

Steve McClaren wants his Middlesbrough team to win their Uefa Cup group by beating Partizan Belgrade.

"The pleasing thing is we did the business in the first two games.

"Winning those two has put us in a great position and it has been a fantastic experience playing these teams."

"To need a win to finish top is fantastic, but it is going to be a tough one," McClaren said.
