Ireland struggled to cope with Italy's fierce start and were indebted to skipper Brian O'Driscoll, who set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer.

Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan heaped praise on Italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in Rome.

Scrum-half Peter Stringer was also glad that Ireland escaped wtih a victory.

"We said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won, and that's how it turned out."
