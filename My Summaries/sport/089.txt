Thanou, 30, and her compatriot Kostas Kenteris were provisionally suspended by the IAAF in December for missing three drugs tests.

Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent Greek tribunal.

And Thanou and Kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident.

"I cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time.

The IAAF - which said it was "very surprised" by the decision of the Greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
