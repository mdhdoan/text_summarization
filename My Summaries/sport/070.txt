From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.

But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans.

Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money.

Something else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds.

I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.
