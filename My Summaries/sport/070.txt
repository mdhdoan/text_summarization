World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes.

And hey, there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record.

From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.

On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid.

But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans.
