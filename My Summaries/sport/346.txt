England will protest to the International Rugby Board (IRB) about the referee's performance in the defeat by Ireland, reports the Daily Mail.

"The International Rugby Board will be disappointed," High told the Daily Mail.

England coach Andy Robinson has called on ex-international referees Colin High and Steve Lander to analyse several of Jonathan Kaplan's decisions.

England were beaten 19-13 by the Irish in Dublin, their third straight defeat in the 2005 Six Nations.
