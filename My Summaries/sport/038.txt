Now Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.

A win in the New York marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year.

And although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of Paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course.

And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens.

If Paula's last experience of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism.
