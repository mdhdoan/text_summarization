Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: "We're not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper."

British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.

Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34.

It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal.

"It's been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination," he added.
