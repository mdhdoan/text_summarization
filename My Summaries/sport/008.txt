Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34.

British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.

Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: "We're not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper."

Hansen, the Commonwealth and European champion, has been sidelined since the European Cup in Poland in June 2004.

It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal.
