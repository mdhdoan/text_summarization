Greg Rusedski has criticised the governing body of men's tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season.

The British number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated ATP supplements.

"I would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it's a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing.

"The first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the Saturday before the Australian Open."

In response, the ATP struck a deal with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men's tour.
