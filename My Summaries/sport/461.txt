Greg Rusedski has criticised the governing body of men's tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season.

The British number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated ATP supplements.

And Rusedski, who takes on Roger Federer at the Qatar Open later on Wednesday, conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial.

"The first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the Saturday before the Australian Open."

"We weren't going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them.
