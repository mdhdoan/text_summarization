Athletics Ireland have hinted that the 35-year-old Cobh runner may be included in the official line-up for the event in France on 19-20 March.

The participation of O'Sullivan, currentily training at her base in Australia, would boost the Ireland team who won the bronze three years agio.

Provincial teams were selected after last Saturday's Nationals in Santry and will be officially announced this week.

The first three at Santry last Saturday, Jolene Byrne, Maria McCambridge and Fionnualla Britton, are automatic selections and will most likely form part of the long-course team.

Sonia O'Sullivan has indicated that she would like to participate in next month's World Cross Country Championships in St Etienne.
