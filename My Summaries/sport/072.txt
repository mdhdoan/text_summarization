It was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to London's 2012 Olympic bid.

When I'm at home, I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London, I was in a pressurised situation, but I found it easy to relax by running.

But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times.

On Wednesday, the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening, so I just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run.
