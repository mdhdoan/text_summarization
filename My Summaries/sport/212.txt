Scotland have not reached a major finals since the World Cup in 1998 and reaching Germany 2006 looks near impossible, having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race.

But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager.

The man who was Alex Ferguson's assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup won seven league titles with Rangers.

Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game.

Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents.
