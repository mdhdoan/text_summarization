Ferguson did not play in the FA Cup win over Colchester on Saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with Rovers boss Mark Hughes claiming it had been an "emotional and difficult time" for the player.

Blackburn have rejected a third bid from Rangers for Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, BBC Sport has learnt.

Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking "unlikely" before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal.

But the player is determined to return to Scotland and rejected a move to Goodison Park.

It is thought Blackburn want Â£6m for the midfielder but chief executive John Williams has confirmed the club are still "in dialogue" with Rangers.
