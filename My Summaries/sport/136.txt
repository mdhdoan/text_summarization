Iranian striker Vahid Hashemian will not travel to Israel for Bayern Munich's Champions League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday.

The German club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury.

A Bayern spokesman said on Monday that the decision not to take Hashemian to Israel had been motivated only by his physical condition.

The International Judo Federation considered taking action against Miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.
