Davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week's Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women.

World number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.

The statement added: "It was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the Wimbledon grounds."

An All England club spokesperson denied Phillips made the remark, insisting: "He definitely didn't say it."

"You hear about women playing only three sets while men play five," said Daveport.
