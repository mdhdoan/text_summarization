Sean Long, Sculthorpe's Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future "I think Sean's situation is to do with the sheer number of games we're playing," he said.

"The way he's looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he's willing to do that.

"A lot of the niggly injuries that I've suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time."

Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play.

But you want the best players in your team, and he's certainly one of the best players in the world."
