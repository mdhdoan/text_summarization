"I would definitely want the job - I make no bones about it," Sculthorpe told BBC Sport.

Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play.

But you want the best players in your team, and he's certainly one of the best players in the world."

"A lot of the niggly injuries that I've suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time."

Sean Long, Sculthorpe's Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future "I think Sean's situation is to do with the sheer number of games we're playing," he said.
