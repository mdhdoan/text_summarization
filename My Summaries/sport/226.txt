The club have confirmed that the former England coach will be unveiled as the successor to Dave Jones at a news conference at Molineux at 1100 GMT.

Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job.

He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player.

His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview.

Hoddle has been linked with a return to former club Southampton but Wolves have won the race for his services.
