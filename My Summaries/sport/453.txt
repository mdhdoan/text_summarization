The Swede was made to graft, American Dent surviving three break points in the fifth game of the match.

Afterwards, Dent said he rated US Open semi-finalist Johansson as a top contender at the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January.

Second seed Joachim Johansson won his second career title with a 7-5 6-3 win over Taylor Dent at the Australian hardcourt championships in Adelaide.

"I believe men's tennis is all about holding serve and if he's playing like that on his own serve I don't see how guys are going to break him," said Dent.

Johansson was more restrained in his assessment: "I have to improve my serve if I'm going to go all the way in Melbourne."
