Wales travel to Edinburgh to take on Scotland in a fortnight and then host Ireland in Cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the Grand Slam and championship decider.

"It was a great game and a magnificent result for Wales," Bennett told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.

But Welsh legend Phil Bennett insisted Wales can cope without Thomas as they chase a first Grand Slam in 27 years.

"With Gareth missing I would think Michael Owen will be our captain," said Wales coach Mike Ruddock.

Thomas will miss the match against Scotland on 13 March, and what promises to be a huge encounter against the Irish six days later.
