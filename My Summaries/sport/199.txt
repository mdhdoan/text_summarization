"In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club's social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.

Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho.

"Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules.

"Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate.

Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a 15.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension.
