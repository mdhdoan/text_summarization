Lewis Moody has flown to Dublin to join England's camp ahead of their RBS Six Nations game against Ireland on Sunday.

Stevens will be winning his third cap on Sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to New Zealand last year.

"I've been on tour with these boys and I've been in the England set-up for two years so I know the calls and the way they play."

Robinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against Irish duo Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game.

He suffered the cut playing against France at Twickenham and it became infected during a 10-minute outing as a replacement for Leicester against Newcastle last Saturday.
