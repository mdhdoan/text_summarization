Johnny O'Connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his RBS Six Nations debut for Ireland against Scotland on Saturday.

The Wasps flanker replaces Denis Leamy but O'Connor knows that the Munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against England.

"It's a good situation to be in if there are good players around you, pushing for a place in the side."

"Missing the Italian game was disappointing certainly, but you can't dwell on these things - it's part and parcel of rugby.

O'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.
