"Women's tennis is really strong," she said, dismissing suggestions that the fact she could still win reflected badly on the women's game.

Navratilova will partner Nathalie Dechy in the doubles event at the Uncle Toby's Hardcourts tournament on Australia's Gold Coast, which begins on Sunday.

She was knocked out in the first round of the French Open but reached the second round at Wimbledon.

And she was so encouraged by her form that she decided to resume playing singles, winning two of her seven matches.

Navratilova has won three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles since she came out of retirement.
