Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round.

David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.

After Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium.

But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups.

Beckham said: "It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won.
