Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March.

"There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game."

Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan.

"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.
