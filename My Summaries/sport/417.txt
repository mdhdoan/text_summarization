The only other change to the Ireland side from last weekend's win in Rome sees Wasps flanker Johnny O'Connor replacing Denis Leamy.

Gordon D'Arcy has been ruled out of the Ireland team for Saturday's Six Nations clash against Scotland in Murrayfield.

''We gave Gordon a chance but it didn't work out,'' said Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan.

D'Arcy injury adds to Ireland woe

O'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.
