It was a dismal defeat for England, coming hard on the heels of an opening Six Nations loss in Wales.

England suffered an eighth defeat in 11 Tests as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili booted France to victory at Twickenham.

A spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until England refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out.

France twice turned over England ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum, one Ben Kay charge apart.

England could have won the game with three minutes left, but Hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide.
