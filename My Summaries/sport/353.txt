Gray, 26, who won his first cap against Australia at Murrayfield last year, was hurt in club action at the weekend.

Star number eight Simon Taylor will miss at least the first two games after damaging an ankle during his comeback.

Scotland doctor James Robson said: "A scan has shown damage to the medial ligaments of Scott's right knee ruling him out of the first part of the Championship.

"We have got plenty of good, young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them, rather than the negatives," Williams added.

Scotland's back row crisis has worsened ahead of the RBS Six Nations with news that Scott Gray will miss out on the opening matches.
