Scotland's back row crisis has worsened ahead of the RBS Six Nations with news that Scott Gray will miss out on the opening matches.

Star number eight Simon Taylor will miss at least the first two games after damaging an ankle during his comeback.

"We have got plenty of good, young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them, rather than the negatives," Williams added.

Gray, 26, who won his first cap against Australia at Murrayfield last year, was hurt in club action at the weekend.

Leeds Tykes flanker Jon Dunbar also trained with the squad but is still awaiting verification of his eligibility to qualify for Scotland.
