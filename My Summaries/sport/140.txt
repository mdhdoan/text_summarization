Rijkaard added: "Chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the English league and they defend very well so I am very pleased with the win.

Barcelona assistant coach Henk Ten Cate has branded Chelsea's expected complaint to Uefa as "pathetic".

The referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to Uefa - weakening Chelsea's case.

Rijkaard was critical of Mourinho's decision not to speak to the media after the match.

"My men deserved victory and I am pleased to have won this match.
