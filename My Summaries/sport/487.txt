The tournament starts on 17 January, and Pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year's tournament following complaints by several Australian players.

"It is faster than last year and that'll be faster than the one Lleyton beat Roger Federer on in the Davis Cup in 2003."

Australian tennis' top official has defended the Australian Open courts at Melbourne Park after criticism of the playing surface by Lleyton Hewitt.

But he refused to accept that the Melbourne surface may have had a bearing on Hewitt's performances over the years.

Hewitt, who has not got past the fourth round at Melbourne in seven attempts, had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament.
