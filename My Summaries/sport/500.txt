While it's a great loss I completely understand and respect his decision to retire from Davis Cup and focus on the Grand Slams and Tour. "

The 30-year-old, who made his Davis Cup debut in 1994, is now set to fully focus on the ATP Tour and on winning his first Grand Slam event.

Tim Henman has retired from Great Britain's Davis Cup team.

Henman and Britain had little luck in Davis Cup matches until 1999 when they qualified for the World Group.

Henman leaves Davis Cup tennis with an impressive record, having won 36 of his 50 matches.
