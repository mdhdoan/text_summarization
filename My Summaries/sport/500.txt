Henman added that he was available to help Britain in its bid for Davis Cup success, with the next tie against Israel in March .

"Looking to the future this decision obviously marks a watershed in British Davis Cup tennis but it is also a huge opportunity for the next generation to make their mark.

While it's a great loss I completely understand and respect his decision to retire from Davis Cup and focus on the Grand Slams and Tour. "

Henman leaves Davis Cup tennis with an impressive record, having won 36 of his 50 matches.

Henman and Britain had little luck in Davis Cup matches until 1999 when they qualified for the World Group.
