With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead.

Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes.

However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal.

McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors.

In the 87th minute, Burton O'Brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by Neil MacFarlane, but Dair sent his shot just inches wide.
