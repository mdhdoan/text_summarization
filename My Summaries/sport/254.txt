Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker.

He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield.

Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips.

But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing."

Anelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club.
