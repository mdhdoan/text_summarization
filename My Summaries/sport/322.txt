Italy have lost both their opening games at home to Ireland and Wales, but travel to Edinburgh with high hopes.

And the pressure is on Scotland coach Matt Williams as he seeks a first Six Nations victory at the eighth attempt.

"I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach," he said, optimistic despite opening defeats to France and Ireland.

Their coach John Kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to Wales however or risk suffering a third successive defeat.

Scotland have also made two changes, Simon Webster replacing Simon Danielli on the wing and Simon Taylor returning for his first Test in a year, for injured flanker Jason White.
