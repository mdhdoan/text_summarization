Boro face Sporting Lisbon for a place in the quarter-finals after the Portuguese side saw off Feyenoord on Thursday.

"But the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium - after the first game here - we'll look forward to it."

Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren hopes that Stewart Downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the 2-1 Uefa Cup win over Graz AK.

"In the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal - but one slip and they were back in it."

"To be fair to Graz, they had a gameplan - they knocked the ball forward, especially in the first half, and we struggled to deal with it.
