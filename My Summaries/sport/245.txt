If the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday.

Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.

It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.

Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot.

More than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play.
