Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei's management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March.

The 29-year-old finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.

KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true.

But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April.

Kenya's athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year.
