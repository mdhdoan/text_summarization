"I'm positive I touched the ball down over the line," Lewsey told BBC Sport.

England's Josh Lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his side's Six Nations loss to Ireland.

"As far as I'm concerned, that incident and Mark Cueto's effort from Charlie Hodgson's cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game."

"I don't think I could have been offside for, without a doubt, I was behind the ball," said the Sale player.

The Wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee Jonathan Kaplan had made a wrong decision.
