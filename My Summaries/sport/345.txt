Despite not playing for England, Wilkinson is still hoping to make the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.

He has not played for England since the World Cup final in November 2003, since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches.

Jonny Wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the 2005 RBS Six Nations.

Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward has not set a deadline for when Wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.

That game is the day after England play Italy in the Six Nations and six days before their final match of the championship against Scotland.
