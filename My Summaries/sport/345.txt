That game is the day after England play Italy in the Six Nations and six days before their final match of the championship against Scotland.

England's World Cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship.

Despite not playing for England, Wilkinson is still hoping to make the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.

But Rob Andrew, coach of Wilkinson's club side Newcastle, said that with only two games left to play Wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time.

He has not played for England since the World Cup final in November 2003, since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches.
