However, under International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules, athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event.

Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte's allegations.

Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories, claims the American sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance.

Pound continued: "If she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people."

World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chief Dick Pound says Marion Jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.
