However, under International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules, athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event.

World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chief Dick Pound says Marion Jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.

"If she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years," said Pound.

Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories, claims the American sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance.

Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte's allegations.
