"Scotland played extremely well against France in Paris but not so well when Ireland came to Edinburgh," said Bortolami.

With both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at Murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider.

Italy skipper Marco Bortolami believes Saturday's Six Nations contest against Scotland will be a scrappy encounter.

This year, Italy opened up with a stubborn display against Ireland but ended up losing 28-17.

Italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the Six Nations in 2000, but two of those have come against Scotland.
