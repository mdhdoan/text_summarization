Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia.

The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy.

"I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights," said the Chelsea star.

Robbie Keane took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory.

"But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win."
