White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case.

Conte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and White said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing.

White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships.

Banned American sprinter Kelli White says she knowingly took steroids given to her by Bay Area Lab Co-Operative (Balco) president Victor Conte.

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil.
