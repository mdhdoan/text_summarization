White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships.

Conte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and White said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing.

White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case.

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil.

The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning.
