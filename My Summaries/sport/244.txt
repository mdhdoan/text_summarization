The former England defender had a year as player-boss with Nottingham Forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job.

"You don't have to be Einstein to realise there will be a manager's job available at a really good club," Pearce told BBC GMR.

He added: "By that time, I will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being Kevin's successor.

Pearce initially joined City as a player under Keegan in 2001 before becoming part of the coaching staff.

Keegan has decided to step down as City manager when his contract comes to an end in 18 months.
