Robben had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday.

"Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again," he told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.

The 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with Roma's Olivier Dacourt.

Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.

Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March.
