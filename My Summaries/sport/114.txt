"But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months."

David Beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan.

Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.

Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March.

"Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again," he told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.
