Wilkinson's year has been disrupted by injury as his muscle problem followed eight months on the sidelines with a shoulder injury sustained in the World Cup final.

Sale's Charlie Hodgson took over the number 10 shirt in the internationals against Canada, South Africa and Australia.

England captain Jonny Wilkinson will make his long-awaited return from injury against Edinburgh on Saturday.

He was subsequently replaced as England captain by full-back Jason Robinson.

The 25-year-old missed England's autumn internationals after aggravating the haematoma in his upper right arm against Saracens.
