England captain Jonny Wilkinson will make his long-awaited return from injury against Edinburgh on Saturday.

Wilkinson's year has been disrupted by injury as his muscle problem followed eight months on the sidelines with a shoulder injury sustained in the World Cup final.

But Newcastle director of rugby Rob Andrew said: "He's fine and we hope to get him into the game at some stage."

He was subsequently replaced as England captain by full-back Jason Robinson.

Sale's Charlie Hodgson took over the number 10 shirt in the internationals against Canada, South Africa and Australia.
