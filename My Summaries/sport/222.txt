Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with European football after the 2-0 Uefa Cup win against Lazio.

To win in Europe you need to defend well, and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games.

"We've got a very good feeling, there is a good spirit, all the lads work hard for each other and it's a squad of friendly players, which I think you can see on the pitch," he added.

"But I had watched Lazio in recent weeks and I saw them score a late equaliser against Inter Milan on Saturday so I knew we needed a second goal.

McClaren's only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals.
