Bath and England centre Mike Tindall believes he can make this summer's Lions tour, despite missing most of the season through injury.

But Tindall, who recently signed for Bath's west-country rivals Gloucester, told Rugby Special he would be fit in time for the tour to New Zealand.

The World Cup winner has been out of action since December, having damaged both his shoulder and his foot.

But after missing out on the 2001 tour to Australia with a knee injury, Tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt.

The 26-year-old will face stiff competition for those centre places from Brian O'Driscoll, Gordon D'Arcy and Gavin Henson, and is aware that competition is intense.
