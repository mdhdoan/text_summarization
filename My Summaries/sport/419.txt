But Tindall, who recently signed for Bath's west-country rivals Gloucester, told Rugby Special he would be fit in time for the tour to New Zealand.

The World Cup winner has been out of action since December, having damaged both his shoulder and his foot.

"I've spoken to Sir Clive Woodward and he understands the situation, so I just hope that I can get on the tour."

Bath and England centre Mike Tindall believes he can make this summer's Lions tour, despite missing most of the season through injury.

The 26-year-old will face stiff competition for those centre places from Brian O'Driscoll, Gordon D'Arcy and Gavin Henson, and is aware that competition is intense.
