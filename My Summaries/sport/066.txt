Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the World Indoor and Olympic titles.

The 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the British men's Olympic squad after a poor start to the Games.

On the eve of the Games, Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.

But it was a different story for Britain's defending champion Denise Lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results.

Britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG.
