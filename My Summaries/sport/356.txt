The World Cup winner missed Wasps' 12-9 loss to Bath on Saturday after injuring his right calf.

The centre, who is in line for a first Six Nations start against Wales, will have to wait 48 hours before knowing the state of his injury.

Scrum-half Matt Dawson is an injury doubt for England's Six Nations opener against Wales next weekend.

Gloucester's Andy Hazell and Leicester star Lewis Moody also received knocks during their respective league matches, but should be fit for Wales next week.
