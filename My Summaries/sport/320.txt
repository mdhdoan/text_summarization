"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right," said Ruddock.

France may have beaten Scotland and England but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches.

"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week."

France have been criticised for the absence of traditional "French flair" as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain Fabien Pelous sees hope on the horizon.

Wales coach Mike Ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship.
