France may have beaten Scotland and England but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches.

"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right," said Ruddock.

Wales coach Mike Ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship.

"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week."

Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.
