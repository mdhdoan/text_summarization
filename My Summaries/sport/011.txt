Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury.

The 31-year-old is concerned the event, which starts on 19 March in France, could upset her preparations for the London Marathon on 17 April.

"But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus.

British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event.

"There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team," said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics.
