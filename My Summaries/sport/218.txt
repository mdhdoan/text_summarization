Chelsea's win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.

Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.

I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind.

They have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match.

It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelsea's squad.
