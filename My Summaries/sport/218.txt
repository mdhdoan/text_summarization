Mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto.

Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League.

Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players.

They have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match.

Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.
