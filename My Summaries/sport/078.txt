Britain's Kathy Butler continued her impressive year with victory in Sunday's 25th Cross Internacional de Venta de Banos in Spain.

Gelete Burka then crowned a great day for Ethiopia by claiming victory in the women's race.

The Scot, who led GB to World Cross Country bronze earlier this year, moved away from the field with Ines Monteiro halfway into the 6.6km race.

Meanwhile, Briton Karl Keska battled bravely to finish seventh in the men's 10.6km race in a time of 31:41.

Butler said of her success: "I felt great throughout the race and hope this is a good beginning for a marvellous 2005 season for me."
