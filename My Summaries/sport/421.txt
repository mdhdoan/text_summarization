The pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals - rather than as team-mates - after Henman decided to retire from Davis Cup tennis leaving Rusedski to lead the team out against Israel on 4-6 March.

Serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set, when Rusedski's wild volley gave Henman a vital break.

It was the first match between the pair for three years - Henman last lost to Rusedski six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes.

"I now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn't recover as quick as it used to, especially after two hours and 40 minutes."

Rusedski won his service game but Henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at Dubai for the first time in three years.
