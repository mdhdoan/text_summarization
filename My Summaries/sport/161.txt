Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League.

Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.

Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.

The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.

The decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup.
