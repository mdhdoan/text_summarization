The star of Ireland's win over Italy in Rome looks like a certainty to make the starting XV against New Zealand.

The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.

Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward.

England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top.

Wales fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me.
