Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology.

Spurs boss Martin Jol said his team were "robbed" at Manchester United after Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.

"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game," Ferguson told MUTV.

"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.
