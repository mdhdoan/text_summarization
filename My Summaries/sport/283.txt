"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game," Ferguson told MUTV.

Spurs boss Martin Jol said his team were "robbed" at Manchester United after Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.

"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology.

Jol added: "We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal.
