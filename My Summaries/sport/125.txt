Arsenal and England defender Cole reportedly met Blues boss Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel 11 days ago.

Both Chelsea and Arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a Premier League commission, but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.

He is a very attacking left-back and I think he is enjoying his football because at Arsenal he plays in an offensive team.

The Premier League is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations Chelsea made an illegal approach for Ashley Cole.

Chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting, which would be in breach of Premier League rule K3.
