"It's hard to put a date on it," a Premier League spokesman confirmed to BBC Sport.

Arsenal and England defender Cole reportedly met Blues boss Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel 11 days ago.

Both Chelsea and Arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a Premier League commission, but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.

And his Arsenal team-mate Robert Pires has urged the England left-back to stay at Highbury.

The Premier League is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations Chelsea made an illegal approach for Ashley Cole.
