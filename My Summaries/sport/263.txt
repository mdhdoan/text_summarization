McLeish told BBC Radio Five Live: "We were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it, we absolutely blew it.

"The early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half.

McLeish admitted his team's defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2-0 to Guy Roux's French side.

"I'm very disappointed because we didn't give ourselves a chance, losing the first goal from our own corner.

"It's difficult to take positives from the game.
