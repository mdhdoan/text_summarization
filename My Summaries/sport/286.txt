France captain Fabien Pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against England at Twickenham since 1997.

France scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat England 18-17 in the Six Nations clash at Twickenham.

Yachvili admitted erratic kicking from England's Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley, who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them, had been decisive.

"We didn't play last week against Scotland and we didn't play in the first half against England," he said.

"The plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure England to losing their composure."
