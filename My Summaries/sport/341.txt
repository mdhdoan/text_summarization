Centre Parker has only a "slim chance" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe's return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.

Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations.

"He will not figure in the Scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game," said Wales physio Mark Davies.

Charvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected.

"We're getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how Robin's looking," added Johnson.
