Curbishley was subjected to criticism from Charlton fans recently, and he said: "The thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction.

"He's part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on.

Curbishley said after the 4-0 win: "There was talk about Norwich being interested in the summer but I have a lot of faith in Jonatan.

"When there was talk of other clubs I just told him he was going nowhere.

I'm sure he's happy here, but I was delighted with all the players."
