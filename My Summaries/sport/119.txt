Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.

John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary.

Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.

And it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth.

The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers.
