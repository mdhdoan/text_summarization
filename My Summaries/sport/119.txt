The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers.

The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil.

England's game against Holland is a good example.

John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary.

Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.
