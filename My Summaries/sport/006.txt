The Olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on France but failed to clear that height.

It was the Russian's 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.

In the men's 60m, former Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene could only finish second to Leonard Scott.

It was Greene's second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow American, who also won in Birmingham last week.

"I am happy even if I know that Maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season."
