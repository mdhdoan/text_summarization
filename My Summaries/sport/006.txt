It was the Russian's 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.

The Olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on France but failed to clear that height.

Pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in Lievin on Saturday.

In the men's 60m, former Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene could only finish second to Leonard Scott.

"I am happy even if I know that Maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season."
