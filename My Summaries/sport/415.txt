"Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate," Hare told BBC Radio Five Live.

"Jonny's not fit yet," Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live.

The 25-year-old has not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries.

England will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew.

England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France.
