England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France.

England will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew.

Andrew also blamed England's poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries.

The 25-year-old has not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries.

Wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 February match for his international comeback - has been missed by England, not least for his goal-kicking.
