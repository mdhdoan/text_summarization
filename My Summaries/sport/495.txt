The last year has seen one player dominate men's tennis, and one country dominate the women's game.

Andy Roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon, and Federer's performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final was breathtaking.

And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open, two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open.

Federer began the year as world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles, and set about conquering new ground.

Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo, whose Grand Slam drought goes on.
