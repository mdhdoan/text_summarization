Paolo di Canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee Paul Alcock over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998.

I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don't pay money to see that sort of thing.

Prutton will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss Harry Redknapp, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player.

Prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenal's Robert Pires, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints' midfield man.

The 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal.
