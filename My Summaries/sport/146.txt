Goals from Gregory Vignal and Nacho Novo gave Rangers a scrappy victory at Celtic Park that moves them three points clear of the champions.

It ended Celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals.

They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield.

But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break.

It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian.
