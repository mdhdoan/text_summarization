The sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture.

Wednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta.

Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game.

I don't agree that players control the game.

"United made a mistake in selling me," Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine.
