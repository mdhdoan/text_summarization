 - Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson: "It wasn't our best performance of the last three months but I think we're deserved winners.

In the opening 45 minutes United had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching Chelsea in the title race.

Manchester United reduced Chelsea's Premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over Manchester City.

But the former Liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against United by side-footing the easy chance wide.

On 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear Rooney's cross and United seemed home and dry.
