England coach Andy Robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee Jonathan Kaplan in his side's Six Nations defeat to Ireland.

Robinson had said he was "livid" about Kaplan's decisions on Saturday to disallow two England "tries."

And the South African has been appointed to take charge of Scotland's match against Wales on 13 March.

"Should the RFU resolve the issue to our satisfaction, as happened last month when the Scotland coach Matt Williams apologised for remarks made, it would be the end of the matter."

Kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in England's 19-13 defeat at Landsdowne Road and admitted he was "very disappointed" with Robinson's remarks.
