England coach Andy Robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee Jonathan Kaplan in his side's Six Nations defeat to Ireland.

Robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the International Rugby Board.

Robinson had said he was "livid" about Kaplan's decisions on Saturday to disallow two England "tries."

The England coach went on to claim that "only one side was refereed".

Kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in England's 19-13 defeat at Landsdowne Road and admitted he was "very disappointed" with Robinson's remarks.
