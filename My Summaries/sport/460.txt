Her career has been hit by a series of injuries but last year she started hitting top form and won seven titles.

The 28-year-old world number one had said that she would quit at the end of last year, but after a successful season she has had a change of heart.

Davenport has won three Grand Slams, the 2000 Australian Open, Wimbledon in 1999 and the 1998 US Open.

"Finally I felt I put myself in a position to try and win Grand Slams again," said Davenport.

She was due to take part in this week's Hopman Cup in Perth but decided she wanted to rest her knee.
