"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries."

"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time," said McCall.

A late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback.

The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end.
