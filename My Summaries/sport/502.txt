Eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament, Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, Nathalie Dechy of France and Russia's Elena Dementieva.

Claude Eerdekens claims the US Open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month.

"The WTA are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims, but I see only two victims in this story - me and Nathalie Dechy, who really have nothing to do with this.

The Women's Tennis Association cleared Kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition.

The Belgian sports minister at the centre of the Svetlana Kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her.
