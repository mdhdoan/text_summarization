However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily."

Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas.

"James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done.

Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: "I don't think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.

The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas "would have stayed down a lot longer" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised.
