Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas.

"James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done.

The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas "would have stayed down a lot longer" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised.

However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily."

The Scot initially defended Beattie, whose dismissal put Everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0, saying Gallas overreacted.
