Manchester United's Brown last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003.

King was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by England's medical staff.

England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's Ledley King from the squad to face Holland.

Chelsea's John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven-Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park.

And Brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England.
