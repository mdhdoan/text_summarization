Manchester United's Brown last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003.

Chelsea's John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven-Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park.

Terry, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of Campbell and Ferdinand.

England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's Ledley King from the squad to face Holland.

King was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by England's medical staff.
