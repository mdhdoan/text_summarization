But we managed to get the ball in our hands and I got a try near the end of the first half.

We were penalised a lot at the breakdown, and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break.

So really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball.

Every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to Brian and Gordon.

We knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the Championship.
