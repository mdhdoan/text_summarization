Ashley Cole has refused to blame Robin van Persie for leaving Arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the FA Cup fifth round replay at Sheffield United.

Van Persie is suspended alongside Dennis Bergkamp and Jose Antonio Reyes after being sent off at Southampton when Arsenal had a numerical advantage.

Arsenal are also without winger Robert Pires, who sustained an ankle injury at St Mary's.

I've been sent off a couple of times now and it's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds.

Thierry Henry is ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury but Cole said: "No-one is putting the blame on Robin.
