Leicester wing Austin Healey hopes to use Sunday's return Heineken Cup clash with Wasps as a further springboard to an England recall for the Six Nations.

Healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his England caps.

Healey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Cup, has been in good form in the Tigers' resurgence this season.

Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers' third try.

Healey, twice a Heineken Cup winner, believes last Sunday's match was "up there" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in.
