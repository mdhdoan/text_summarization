Holmes will have now have intensive treatment in South Africa.

The 34-year-old made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the 1,000m title at the Birmingham Grand Prix 10 days ago.

Kelly Holmes has been forced out of this weekend's European Indoor Athletics Championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training.

After that race and more progress in training, Holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the European Indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend.

Holmes has now been advised by her coach Margot Jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer.
