Eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last Friday to the player's address in Spain, as well as to the Belgian prosecutors' office and the Belgian and Russian tennis federations.

US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug, according to Belgian authorities.

"First of all, this Belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing, without any basic evidence," Tarpishchev said.

The situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), the International Tennis Federation (ITF) or the Women's Tennis Accosiation (WTA).

If there is a positive sample, then they should notify the International Tennis Federation (ITF) as well as the national federation within three days," he said.
