The Falcons were 22-6 down at the break before Tait, recently axed by England after just one Six Nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead.

The former All Black broke clear and popped the ball up for Tait on halfway.

With three minutes of normal time left, Narraway was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27.

Newcastle centre Mathew Tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another, but he could not stop Gloucester grabbing a draw.

Mayerhofler then scythed through the middle for a try after Hall Charlton popped the ball up, and Walder's conversion took Newcastle 27-22 ahead.
