Speaking to the Greek Parliament on Tuesday, Sevastis said that the evidence sent by the International Olympic Committee and athletics governing body the IAAF was not strong enough for the Greek Association to find the sprinters guilty.

The athletes are technically free to compete while the IAAF reviews its response to the decision to clear Kenteris and Thanou.

The careers of sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are over, says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test.

Greek Athletics Federation boss Vassilli Sevastis told the country's parliament: "I believe Kenteris and Thanou won't race again.

Athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling, while the athletes face a trial in a Greek court.
