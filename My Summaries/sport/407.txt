Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty.

Six Chris Paterson penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.

And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes.

Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.

Italy's De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright.
