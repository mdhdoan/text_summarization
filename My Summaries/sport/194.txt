Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann has warned goalkeeper Jens Lehmann he may have to quit Arsenal to keep his World Cup dreams alive.

Lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006.

Klinsmann said: "It will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club.

"The situation for Jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at Arsenal.

"If Jens is not Arsenal's number one keeper, that is a problem for me.
