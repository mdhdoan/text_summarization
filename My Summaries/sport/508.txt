Nadal, playing in the outdoor clay event for the first time, hit some powerful forehands to oust Starace in a match delayed over an hour by rain.

He will now play Gaston Gaudio, who beat unseeded Brazilian Flavio Saretta 6-3 6-2 in the day's late match.

"It's always a problem to have to stop for rain but one gets used to it," said Spanish teenager Nadal.

"Luckily, I was able to keep my pace going throughout the match."

Compatriot and seventh seed Rafael Nadal also reached the last eight, beating Italian Potito Starace 6-1 6-3.
