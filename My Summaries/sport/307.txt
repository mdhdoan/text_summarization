Six years earlier, also in New Zealand, Grewcock became only the second England player to be sent off in Tests.

Wales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel.

Last June Grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against New Zealand.

Trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of Wales' 11-9 win in Cardiff as Grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving Peel bloodied.

In the forthcoming games, Ruddock may use penalty hero Gavin Henson as his first-choice kicker in place of Stephen Jones.
