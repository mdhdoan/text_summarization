Dominik Hrbaty, who had not lost a set in his three singles matches in the group stages, then upset world number seven Guillermo Coria 6-4 6-1.

World number 31 Hantuchova, ranked two places above Dulko, looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match.

Slovakia's win made up for last year's final defeat to the United States.

Dulko, who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages, grew in confidence and took the opening set in just 27 minutes.

Slovakia clinched the Hopman Cup for the second time by beating Argentina 3-0 in Saturday's final in Perth.
