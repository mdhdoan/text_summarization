Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job.

The ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season.

He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player.

His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview.

Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton.
