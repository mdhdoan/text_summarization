American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2.

Australian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia's Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4.

Davenport defeated China's Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt.

Before her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game.

"I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts," she said.
