The 2003 champion claimed her seventh Grand Slam title, and her first since Wimbledon in 2003, 2-6 6-3 6-0.

The 23-year-old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action.

Davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second.

She quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as Davenport's game collapsed, allowing Williams to take the title.

Williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games.
