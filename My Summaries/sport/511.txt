Roddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set.

Saulnier battled to a 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3 win over seventh seed Jurgen Melzer, who twisted his ankle early in the second set.

"It's extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don't do anything with them," admitted Haas.

The American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany's Tommy Haas, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.

"I was feeling horrible earlier in the week," Roddick said.
