Almunia was at fault for Rosenborg's goal in Arsenal's 5-1 Champions League win on Tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week's win over Birmingham.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the January transfer window.

Wenger has brought in Manuel Almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form Jens Lehmann - but the Spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes.

The Gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old Almunia has made to his career at Highbury.

And he would not be drawn on whether Lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with Chelsea on Sunday.
