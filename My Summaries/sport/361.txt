The 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli's player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey.

The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.

"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early," said Hodges.

Hodges described his years at Stradey as "the best time of my life."

He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season.
