"We do not play a season with 11 players and I believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team."

Arsenal go into the game on the back of a 2-0 victory over Fulham on Sunday.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why Newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table.

"Fatigue won't play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so I can rotate a bit more.

"We are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that.
