England forward Michael Owen has told the BBC he is happy in Spain and has no plans to quit Real Madrid to return to the Premiership in the near future.

Recent speculation has linked Owen with a move back to England, with Newcastle expressing their interest, but the England striker said he is not ready to return home.

"But as much as our press like to build it up as if I've permanently had my backside on the bench, I've played as many games as anyone else in the team this year.

Owen, who moved to the Bernabeu from Liverpool last summer, has grabbed 11 goals for Real but has been unable to replace Raul or Ronaldo in the starting line-up.

However, he said he was delighted with the way his time in Spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join Real.
