The FA is to take action after trouble marred Wednesday's Carling Cup tie between Chelsea and West Ham.

Mateja Kezman, the scorer of Chelsea's goal, needed treatment on a head injury during the match after being hit by a missile, believed to be a coin.

The FA is already looking into the trouble at Tuesday's heated Carling Cup tie between Millwall and Liverpool.

A spokeswoman for Chelsea said the club would await the referee's report before deciding on its course of action.

Police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the West Ham support after the match which the Blues won 1-0.
