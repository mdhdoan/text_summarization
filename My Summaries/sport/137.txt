Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: "Vieira was well wound up for it.

The Football Association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the Arsenal and Manchester United game.

"Especially from players of that calibre, but it's a tough game and we've been around a long time."

Arsenal's Patrick Vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened Gary Neville before the 4-2 defeat.

"There were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you," he said.
