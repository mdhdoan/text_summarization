The Football Association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the Arsenal and Manchester United game.

"Especially from players of that calibre, but it's a tough game and we've been around a long time."

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: "Vieira was well wound up for it.

"There were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you," he said.

"The referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time," said an FA statement.
