Striker Nicolas Anelka reportedly wants to leave Manchester City in search of Champions League football.

"Playing for eighth place is good but I miss the Champions League.

Anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.

"I won it with Real Madrid in 2000 and I need to be playing in it - and I should be playing in it.

Anelka, 25, is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with City but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club.
