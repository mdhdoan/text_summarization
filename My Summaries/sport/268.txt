The England defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take Arsenal back into second spot, five points behind Chelsea.

The England defender needed little invitation as Pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past Ashdown.

Fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to Aiyegbeni Yakubu, who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury.

Fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when Patrik Berger's break and slipped pass played him clear.

Ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and Kolo Toure headed just wide and, as Arsenal began to press, Van Persie blasted over a good opportunity after Henry had set him up.
