Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll has been ruled out of Saturday's RBS Six Nations clash against Scotland.

O'Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.

The only other change to the Ireland side sees Wasps flanker Johnny O'Connor replacing Denis Leamy.

O'Driscoll was originally named in the starting line-up but has failed to recover from the hamstring injury he picked up in the win over Italy.
