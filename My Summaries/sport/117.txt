Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.

His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club.

The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for Â£1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria.

Sociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis.

Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi.
