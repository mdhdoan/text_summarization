Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.

The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for Â£1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria.

His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club.

Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.

Sociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis.
