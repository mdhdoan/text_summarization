Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year.

The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title.

And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.

For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form.

Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage.
