The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title.

Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year.

For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form.

British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid.

And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.
