Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.

Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: "We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter.

Ireland fly-half Ronan O'Gara hailed his side's 19-13 victory over England as a "special" win.

Ireland hooker Shane Byrne echoed O'Gara's comments but admitted the game had been England's best outing in the Six Nations.

O'Driscoll also insisted Ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the Six Nations title.
