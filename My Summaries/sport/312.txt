Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.

Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes.

Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try.

Henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline.

Stephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out.
