Any decision on the medals would be taken by the IOC's executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that Olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the Games closing.

An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee.

The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.

Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics.

"Victor Conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward," she said.
