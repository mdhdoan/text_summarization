Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season.

Clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season.

Four-time champion Monica Seles, who has not played since last year's French Open, is another absentee because of an injured left foot.

Kim Clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of January's Australian Open because of her persistent wrist injury.

The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour.
