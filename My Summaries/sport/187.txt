Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy is discussing a possible short-term loan move to Celtic, BBC Sport understands.

And it is unlikely that Newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another Premiership club.

The Toon boss vowed Bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against Arsenal.

Bellamy was fined two weeks' wages after a live TV interview in which he accused Souness of lying, following a very public dispute about what position Bellamy should play in the side.

According to Bellamy's agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to Birmingham.
