"The Scotland v England match was a highlight of the end of the season," he added.

"England were criticised for the 0-0 draw against Holland - the way Scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies.

"I was in Italy for their friendly with Russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20,000 fans turned up to watch.

Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series.

But Smith said: "Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed."
