Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admitted victory against Deportivo La Coruna was vital in their tight Champions League group.

"It is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level."

"But in the end because of the way that (Dietmar) Hamann and (Igor) Biscan performed, we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match.

Jorge Andrade's early own goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win.

"I want to see us win away matches in the Champions League, that it was in Spain was not my first consideration.
