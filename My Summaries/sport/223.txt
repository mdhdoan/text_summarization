Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admitted victory against Deportivo La Coruna was vital in their tight Champions League group.

"I want to see us win away matches in the Champions League, that it was in Spain was not my first consideration.

"It is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level."

Jorge Andrade's early own goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win.

Benitez added: "It is all back in our own hands now, it was a great win for us and I was delighted with what I feel was the best Liverpool I have seen.
