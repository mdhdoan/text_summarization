At the Australian Open in January, Mirza became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam before losing to eventual champion Serena Williams.

Mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd, she broke Bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.

And a year ago, she became the youngest Indian to win a professional title by claiming the doubles at the Hyderabad Open.

In a see-saw second set, Bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though Mirza hauled herself level, the Ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match.

Mirza, ranked 134 in the world, sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against Bondarenko.
