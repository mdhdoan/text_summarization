At the Australian Open in January, Mirza became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam before losing to eventual champion Serena Williams.

Mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd, she broke Bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.

In a see-saw second set, Bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though Mirza hauled herself level, the Ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match.

Mirza, ranked 134 in the world, sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against Bondarenko.

At 5-3, the stadium erupted in celebration when Mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net.
