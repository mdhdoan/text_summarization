Double Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the World Cross Country Championships in France.

 - Britain's Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships.

And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records.

But the four-time world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career.

But the Moroccan, who has not raced over cross country for 15 years, will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 March.
