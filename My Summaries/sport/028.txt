The Newport-based athlete and team-mates Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis were rewarded with MBEs in the New Year Honours List.

He was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell's injury claims.

"To go to Athens and finally get the gold I've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief," said Campbell.

The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.

And he ran 20.13secs in the quarter-finals of the 200m in Sydney on the way to Olympic silver.
