Double Olympic 10,000m champion Haile Gebrselassie will race in the London Marathon for the next three years.

Gebrselassie will face Olympic champion Stefano Baldini, world champion Jaouad Gharib, and arch-rival Paul Tergat, the current world record holder.

The Ethiopian legend won Sunday's Almeria half-marathon in Spain on his return from an operation on his Achilles tendon.

"There are a lot of fantastic runners in the race but I shall be doing my utmost to upset them."

"It is a coup for us to secure Haile's presence for the next three years and it guarantees a quality race," said race director David Bedford.
