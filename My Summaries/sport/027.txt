Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has been voted European Athletics (EAA) woman athlete of 2004 in the governing body's annual poll.

Swedish triple jumper Christian Olsson was voted male athlete of the year.

Her gutsy victory in the 800m also earned her the International Association of Athletics Federations' award for the best women's performance in the world for 2004.

She is only the second British woman to land the title after- Sally Gunnell won for her world 400m hurdles win in 1993.

The accolade is the latest in a long list of awards that Holmes has received since her success in Athens.
