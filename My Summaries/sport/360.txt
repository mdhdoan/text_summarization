"Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season," Robinson told BBC Sport.

England coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players' careers.

Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.

Rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago.

"I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers."
