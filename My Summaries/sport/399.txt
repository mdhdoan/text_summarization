"As well as the Rugby Football Union, the league, the individual club and the England coaching team have a say, so it's not a quick decision," he said.

Leicester and Saracens are leading the chase for the player, but Lindsay told the BBC it was not yet a done deal.

Although the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club.

"But he's a very loyal friend to the club, so there's no question that he's deserting us.

"Even if we did have it, under the salary cap we can't spend a penny of it anyway - we'd rather have the player."
