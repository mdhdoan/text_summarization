"As well as the Rugby Football Union, the league, the individual club and the England coaching team have a say, so it's not a quick decision," he said.

Although the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club.

Leicester and Saracens are leading the chase for the player, but Lindsay told the BBC it was not yet a done deal.

The prospect of Farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the Super League season so far.

"The money side of things hasn't been concluded, but it's not the point for Wigan," he told Radio Five Live.
