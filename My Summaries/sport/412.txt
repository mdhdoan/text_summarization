France , Ireland and Wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year's RBS Six Nations, with the two Celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.

Wing Christophe Dominici says France can claim another Six Nations Grand Slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against Scotland and England.

France take on Wales at the Stade de France on 26 February and Ireland in Dublin on 12 March.

France coach Bernard Laporte will announce his starting line-up next Tuesday for the match against Wales.

The champions only just saw off the Scots in Paris, then needed England to self-destruct in last week's 18-17 win.
