John Sivabaek told BBC Sport: "I'm here to listen to what Real have to say.

Real Madrid general manager Arrigo Sacchi is the driving force behind the move, convincing vice-president Emilio Butragueno and new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo that Gravesen is the right man for the Bernabeu.

Nothing has been agreed, but this is a big opportunity for any player."

Real Madrid are closing in on a Â£2m deal for Everton's Thomas Gravesen after the Dane's agent travelled to Spain to hold talks about a move.

Gravesen has been outstanding as Everton have established themselves in the Premiership's top four this season.
