Real Madrid general manager Arrigo Sacchi is the driving force behind the move, convincing vice-president Emilio Butragueno and new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo that Gravesen is the right man for the Bernabeu.

Real Madrid are closing in on a Â£2m deal for Everton's Thomas Gravesen after the Dane's agent travelled to Spain to hold talks about a move.

Everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer for Real and risk their own ambitions for European football.

Gravesen has been outstanding as Everton have established themselves in the Premiership's top four this season.

Nothing has been agreed, but this is a big opportunity for any player."
