But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: "I sincerely hope he will be.

Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: "I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.

Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.

It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.

But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future.
