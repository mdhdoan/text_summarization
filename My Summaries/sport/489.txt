After losing in round one last year, Safin said he had "given up" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind.

However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles.

"After the first final that I didn't win against Thomas Johansson (in 2002), I couldn't see myself winning the Grand Slams anymore.

Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam.

The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals.
