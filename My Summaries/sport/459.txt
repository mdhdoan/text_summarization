The Swiss world number one reeled off a series winners to outclass the Spaniard and set up a semi-final match against Russian Nikolay Davydenko.

But the Swiss saved a break point and promptly broke serve in the following game to seize control.

Roger Federer reached the last four of the Qatar Open with an easy 6-1 6-2 win over seventh seed Feliciano Lopez.

Fabrice Santoro completed a miserable day for France when he was forced to retire when 6-2 3-0 down to Albert Costa.

"I think I played better than against Greg Rusedski and I am happy I am playing so well," said the top seed.
