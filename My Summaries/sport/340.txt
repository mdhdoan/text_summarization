Castaignede told BBC Sport: "The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England.

But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener.

Laporte has been criticised for France's negative tactics in their wins over Scotland and England.

Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world's leading side.

Former France fly-half Thomas Castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach Bernard Laporte following their defeat by Wales.
