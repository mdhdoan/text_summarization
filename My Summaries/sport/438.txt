An All England club spokesperson denied Phillips made the remark, insisting: "He definitely didn't say it."

Davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week's Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women.

World number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.

"But it's a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn't make it better or worse.

"You hear about women playing only three sets while men play five," said Daveport.
