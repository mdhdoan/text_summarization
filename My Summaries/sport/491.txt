Both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the Spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when Roddick drives wide.

After Moya's win in the opening rubber, a raucous Seville crowd is buoyed by Nadal's impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead.

One thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of Nadal and they go wild when Roddick loses the next point and goes break point down.

Roddick holds serve to force Nadal to serve for the match but the American surely cannot turn things around now.

A pulsating game sees Nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give Roddick any easy points.
