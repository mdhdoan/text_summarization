James McIlroy motored to the AAA's Indoor 800m title in Sheffied on Sunday in a time of one minute, 47.97 seconds.

McIlroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his build-up for the European Indoors at Madrid on 4-6 March.

The Larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from Welshman Jimmy Watkins in the final 100 metres.

Willowfield claimed their first men's team title in 72 years while Shannon helped Lagan Valley win the women's team honours.

Meanwhile, Stephen Cairns and Jill Shannon claimed the individual titles at Saturday's Northern Ireland Cross Country Championship in Coleraine.
