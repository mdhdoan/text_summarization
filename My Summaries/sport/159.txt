Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has insisted that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger would swap places with him.

Mourinho's side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle last Sunday before seeing Barcelona secure a 2-1 Champions League first-leg lead in the Nou Camp.

"In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea."

But he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals Arsenal and Manchester United could exploit.

"We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.
