"It will be a very exciting game because Ireland have three wins under their belt, have just defeated England and have their eyes set on a Grand Slam."

Number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been dropped from France's squad for the Six Nations match with Ireland in Dublin on 12 March.

France, who lost to Wales last week, must defeat the Irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the Six Nations trophy.

Ireland are unbeaten in this year's tournament and have their sights set on a first Grand Slam since 1948.

Rougerie hurt his chest against Wales while Grandclaude was a second-half replacement against both England and Wales.
