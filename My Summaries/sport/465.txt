Henin-Hardenne was speaking after a 6-2 5-7 6-2 loss to world number six Dementieva in Charleroi, Belgium, on Sunday.

A comeback at the US Open after a three-month absence ended when she crashed out at the fourth-round stage.

The previous day, the Olympic champion went down 6-2 7-5 to France's Nathalie Dechy.

But despite her problems, she still won five of the nine official tournaments she entered in 2004 and won Olympic gold in Athens, an achievement which saw her named Belgian sportswoman of the year on Friday.

"But I think there'll be less pressure than last time even if I am champion."
