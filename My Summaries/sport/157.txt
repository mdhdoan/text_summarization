Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was "our worst peformance in the Champions League".

Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: "Do I blame myself for the third goal?

My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.

"Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf."

In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens.
