Bath prop Duncan Bell has been added to England's 30-man squad to face Ireland in the RBS Six Nations.

But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998.

England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row.

Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester's record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday.

England's players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday.
