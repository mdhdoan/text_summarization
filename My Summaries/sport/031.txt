Former European 200m champion Dougie Walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness.

"I still enjoy training, but feel it's time to move on, and concentrate on a career."

He told the Herald newspaper: "I'm not in great shape, after missing about a month of training.

Walker had hoped to compete in the New Year Sprint which is staged at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The 31-year-old Scot was suspended for two years in 1998 after testing positive for nandrolone.
