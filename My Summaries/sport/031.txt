Former European 200m champion Dougie Walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness.

"I still enjoy training, but feel it's time to move on, and concentrate on a career."

The 31-year-old Scot was suspended for two years in 1998 after testing positive for nandrolone.

"I had intended to race but I'm running like a goon," said Walker.

"I missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks, and then another week working in America.
