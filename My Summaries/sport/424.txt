Andy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.

Roddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set.

"It's extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don't do anything with them," admitted Haas.

"I was feeling horrible earlier in the week," Roddick said.
