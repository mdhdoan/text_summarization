After losing in round one last year, Safin said he had "given up" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind.

Newly-crowned Australian Open champion Marat Safin has ruled out any chance of winning Wimbledon in the future.

However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles.

The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals.

I think I have a chance if I continue this way.
