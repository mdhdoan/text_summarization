Wales international Williams, whose contract with the Welsh region was due to expire in June, has agreed a contract until the end of the season.

Williams, capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, should figure in the match squad for Monday's Zurich Premiership match at Sale Sharks.

"He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath," Rowell told Bath's official website.

With Martyn Wood's injury likely to keep him out until February, Bath need experienced back-up to Nick Walshe.

Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell, though, believes Williams fits the bill perfectly.
