Newcastle's teenage centre Mathew Tait has been named as a centre in England's team to face Wales in the Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.

England coach Andy Robinson has also awarded Gloucester flanker Andy Hazell his first Six Nations start.

Robinson was already without Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Stuart Abbott, Richard Hill and Will Greenwood, while Mike Catt had been left out of England's squad.

The 18-year-old will play alongside Falcons' team-mate Jamie Noon in England's midfield.
