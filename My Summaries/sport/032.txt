Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.

The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year.

Britain's 800m and 1500m champion Kelly Holmes is taking part in the 1000m.

Gebrselassie's current record stands at eight minutes, 04.69 seconds.

Compatriots Mulugeta Wondimu, Abiyote Abate and Markos Geneti, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against Bekele on 18 February.
