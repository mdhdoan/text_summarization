Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.

Britain's 800m and 1500m champion Kelly Holmes is taking part in the 1000m.

"And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets."

While men's 4x100m relay gold medallists Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis will go head-to-head in the 60m.

The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year.
