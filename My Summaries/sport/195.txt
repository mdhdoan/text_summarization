Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: "The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened.

"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support."

Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.

The agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil.

"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes."
