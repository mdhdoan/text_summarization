The only other Indian woman to win a match at a Grand Slam is Nirupama Vaidyanathan.

Sania Mirza, the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tennis event, has lost to women's favourite Serena Williams.

Playing the biggest match of her life, Mirza made little impact on Williams in the early stages of the game.

Tennis is not a particularly popular sport in India, but a number of Indians watched the live telecast of the match between Mirza and Williams.

Williams took just 56 minutes to defeat Mirza and sail into the fourth round.
