The season would start with the Celtic League in October, followed by the Heineken Cup in February and March, and the Six Nations moved to April and May.

Moving the Six Nations from its traditional February beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and "stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing", Pickering argued.

WRU chairman David Pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country.

The plan will be put before the International Rugby Board next month, where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed.

The Welsh Rugby Union wants to restructure the Northern Hemisphere season into four separate blocks.
