The 24-year-old England midfielder is determined to see out his contract, despite reported interest from Chelsea.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at Anfield and win trophies with the club.

Gerrard looked set to move to Chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to Stamford Bridge has again arisen, with the January transfer window approaching.

Meanwhile, Gerrard has urged the Anfield board to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes in the January transfer window.

Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has insisted that Gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at Anfield.
