Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.

Athletics' ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.

They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games.

The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF.

Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the IAAF at an independent tribunal this weekend.
