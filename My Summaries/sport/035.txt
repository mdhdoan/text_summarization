America's former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use.

"The CAS panel's decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA's ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free," said Madden.

"Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time."

Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer.
