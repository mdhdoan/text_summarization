America's former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use.

The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer.

"Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time."

"The CAS panel's decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA's ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free," said Madden.

His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.
