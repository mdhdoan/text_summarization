The England coach said that he had been impressed by Wright-Phillips' form for Manchester City.

England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has revealed Shaun Wright-Phillips will start against the Netherlands.

But Wright-Phillips will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected.

"Johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals.

And he added that Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress.
