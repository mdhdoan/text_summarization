Henson was twice repelled as Wales laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgson's penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time.

A mesmeric display against England, topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty, has secured life membership of that particular club.

There were still four minutes for Wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away.

But it was Wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.

The second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when England were starting to show menace.
