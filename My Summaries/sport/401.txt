One game into his Six Nations career, and Gavin Henson is already a Welsh legend.

Henson was twice repelled as Wales laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgson's penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time.

A mesmeric display against England, topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty, has secured life membership of that particular club.

The second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when England were starting to show menace.

But it was Wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.
