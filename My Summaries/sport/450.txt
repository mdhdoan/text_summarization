Hewitt has now lifted the Sydney title four times in the last six years.

Lleyton Hewitt gave himself the perfect preparation for next week's Australian Open with victory over Ivo Minar in the final of the Sydney International.

The Australian world number three strolled to the first five games of the match but was shocked as Minar won the next five.

The top seed was rattled but recovered to close out the set and raced to victory in exactly an hour.

Hewitt went into the final as a short-priced favourite to clinch his 24th career title after dropping only one set all week.
