I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you've done that kind of thing, it's the result you look for.

Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their side's 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South.

"All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved."

"Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw.

Dundee United manager Ian McCall has won a reprieve from the sack, with chairman Eddie Thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future.
