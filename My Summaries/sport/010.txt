World and Commonwealth 100m champion Kim Collins will compete in the 60m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.

The St Kitts and Nevis star joins British Olympic relay gold medallists Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis.

"Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis are Olympic gold medallists now and I'm sure they'll be aiming to win in front of their home supporters.

Collins was sixth in the Olympic final in Athens but is hoping for a better result at the World Championships in Finland this summer.

Before then I want to perform well over 60m indoors and start my year in winning form."
