Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff.

Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road.

Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales.

A second-half try from captain Brian O'Driscoll and 14 points from Ronan O'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948.

England took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry.
