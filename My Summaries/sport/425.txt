But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance.

World number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.

The match was a re-run of last week's final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him for five sets.

"After those first three games it was no match at all.

"I had a chance in the third, and for me it's really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match.
