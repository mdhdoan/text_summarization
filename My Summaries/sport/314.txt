An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try.

Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.

The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.

A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks.

Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.
