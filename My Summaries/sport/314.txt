P O'Brien (New Zealand)

Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.

An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try.

The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.

Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.
