Ballymena sprinter Paul Brizzel will be among eight of Ireland's European Indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend's AAA's Championships.

In-form James McIlroy will hope to confirm his place in the British team for Madrid by winning the 800m title.

An injury crisis in the Annadale Striders squad led to Donnelly being entered by coach John McLaughlin but the athlete told BBC Sport on Friday evening that he would not be running.

Meanwhile, nine-times champion Dermot Donnelly will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the Northern Ireland Cross Country Championships in Coleraine on Saturday.

Carroll is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with Cragg occupying top spot.
