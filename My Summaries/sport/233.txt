Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe was desperate to give former academy director Wigley, who replaced Paul Sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary's.

But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with Mandaric's decision to bring in Velimir Zajec as executive director.

Redknapp's first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday.

Pompey coach Kevin Bond is poised to join Redknapp, who will be Saints' third boss of the season.

When Redknapp's appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints' ninth manager in eight years.
