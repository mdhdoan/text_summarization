"That's the Grand Slams and Melbourne's as big for me as any of the four.

"When you've been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams, you look at the big picture and what motivates you," said Hewitt.

Lleyton Hewitt suffered a shock defeat to Taylor Dent in the quarter-finals of the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide on Friday.

"I felt like I had a lot of break chances, I didn't take care of them all, but I broke him four times and he only broke me once.

Hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January.
