"When you've been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams, you look at the big picture and what motivates you," said Hewitt.

Hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January.

The top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the American.

"I felt like I had a lot of break chances, I didn't take care of them all, but I broke him four times and he only broke me once.

Even if I don't win Sydney next week it's no big deal."
