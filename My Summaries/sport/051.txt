Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are expected to find out on Wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.

The Greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident.

Just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens before withdrawing from the Games.

But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early.

The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be.
