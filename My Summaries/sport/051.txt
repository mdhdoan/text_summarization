Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are expected to find out on Wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.

Just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens before withdrawing from the Games.

Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be.

But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early.
