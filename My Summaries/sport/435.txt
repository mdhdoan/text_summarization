Sania Mirza continued her remarkable rise with victory over US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova at the Dubai Championships on Tuesday.

Hantuchova has risen from 31 in the world at the turn of the year to number 22, having reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals at her last two events.

Mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against Kuznetsova.

Earlier, Daniela Hantuchova built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed Alicia Molik.

It was Mirza's sixth straight victory following her first WTA tournament win in Hyderabad last month.
