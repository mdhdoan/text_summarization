First of all Boukar Makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game Andre Nzame III was on target.

In the other Group B game Cameroon's Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba .

Louis Agyemang scored the first two goals for Hearts either side of half time before Ben Don Bortey scored the third.

Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through.

The win for Hearts means they will play Asante Kotoko in the two-leg final, after the Kumasi team qualified from Group A on Saturday.
