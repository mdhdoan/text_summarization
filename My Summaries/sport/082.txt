Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.

The duo had been provisionally suspended by the IAAF for allegedly missing three drugs tests, including one on the eve of the Athens Olympics.

They withdrew from the Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.

It was the International Olympic Committee's demand that the IAAF investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the Greek tribunal.

"This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one.
