Chelsea's Damien Duff has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona at the Nou Camp.

The Blues boss took the unusual step of naming his side a day before the match, with Jole Cole named in midfield.

Duff sustained a knee injury in the FA Cup defeat at Newcastle and manager Jose Mourinho said: "He cannot run.

Drogba, Chelsea's Â£24m striker, has missed the last three weeks through injury.

But Mourinho has revealed defender Willian Gallas and striker Didier Drogba will be in the starting line-up.
