Eighth seed Nadal, who picked up his second ATP title when he beat Alberto Martin in last week's Brazil Open, saw off the Argentine third seed 7-5 6-3.

He now meets Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who followed up his win over top seed Carlos Moya by overcoming Spain's Felix Mantilla, 6-4 3-6 7-6.

Calleri won his only ATP title in Acapulco two years ago while Novak won the singles and doubles titles in 1998.

The unseeded Argentine, who won the tournament two years ago, now plays Spain's Albert Montanes.

Calleri will face Albert Montanes in the semi-finals after the Spaniard ousted sixth seed Filippo Volandri of Italy 4-6 6-3 6-4.
