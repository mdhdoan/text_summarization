Manchester United's Alex Ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa.

"I look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do."

"That was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end-to-end with lots of good passing," said the Old Trafford boss.

"Roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got.
