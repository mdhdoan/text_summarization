The final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with Australia's triumph in London followed by France's capitulation to New Zealand.

But the manner of New Zealand's 45-6 demolition job in Paris has coach Bernard Laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard.

A stunning defeat to Argentina, their first loss since the World Cup, could have been attributed to trademark French inconsistency.

And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title.

A fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if England emerge triumphant from an opening Six Nations engagement in Cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.
