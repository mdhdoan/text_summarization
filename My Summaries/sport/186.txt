Stuart, a former England Under-21 international, made 110 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 18 goals, before joining Everton.

After signing for Charlton he made 164 appearances, scoring 23 times, but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the Londoners for three months before heading to Norwich.

Stuart spent just over four years at Goodison Park, making 125 senior appearances and scoring 25 goals, before signing for Sheffield United - where he scored 12 goals in 68 appearances.

Stuart has extensive top-flight experience with Everton, Chelsea and Charlton and can play across the midfield positions.

Norwich have signed Charlton midfielder Graham Stuart until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee.
