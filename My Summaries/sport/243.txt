"The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time," he said afterwards.

Gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the Reds after his superb Champions League winner on Wednesday.

Gerrard had said before Wednesday's game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of Europe, with Real Madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation.

Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry insists the club will never sell Steven Gerrard amid reports Chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from Anfield.

Gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give Liverpool a 3-1 win over Olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages.
