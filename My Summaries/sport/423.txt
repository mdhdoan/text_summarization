Among the low points of a difficult year for Ferrero was the decision of Spain captain Jordi Arrese to drop him for the Davis Cup final against the USA.

"I was working very hard before the Davis Cup final to prepare and I've felt 100% from then until now.

"I don't know when it is going to happen," Ferrero told BBC Sport.

Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005.

The 2003 French Open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return.
