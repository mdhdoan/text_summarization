Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.

Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front.

Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days.

France's Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova.

Mauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot.
