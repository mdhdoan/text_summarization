The Lions leave for New Zealand on 24 May, with the first Test match against the All Blacks in Christchurch on 25 June.

Woodward's decision to call in Prime Minister Tony Blair's former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last Lions tour of Australia in 2001, when New Zealander Graham Henry was the head coach.

Former government communications chief Alastair Campbell will act as a media consultant to Sir Clive Woodward's 2005 Lions on their tour to New Zealand.

"There will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media, the fans that will go out in their thousands and the New Zealand public.

Campbell, who left Downing Street earlier this year, will advise on media strategy before and during the tour.
