Hassell warns that Juninho could reconsider his future at Celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the January transfer window.

"We have already spoken with Juninho and he said, if he has no firm offer from a club in Spain, Veracruz will be his destination," Sanchez told his club's official website.

"Players get a game on merit.

"The onus is on Juninho to force his way into the team," he said.

Juninho was signed from Middlesbrough during the summer, but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to 18-year-old Aiden McGeady.
