The 21-year-old Blues prop is the only uncapped player in Wales' Six Nations squad, gaining a chance in the absence of Ospreys loose-head Duncan Jones.

Ruddock hopes that the selection of Yapp and Dragons lock Ian Gough - out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach Steve Hansen - will send a message to other players in Wales.

Ruddock's assessment was backed up by Yapp's coach at the Blues, former Wales and Lions prop Dai Young.

"We believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of Welsh rugby, and based on the performances in the November internationals.

Wales coach Mike Ruddock says John Yapp has what it takes as an international.
