Federer, who has not had a coach since he split from Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick to win the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals.

"The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time," said Roddick.

But Roddick slipped to second this year behind Roger Federer, who became the first man since 1988 to win three Majors in a season.

He won his first Grand Slam event at Flushing Meadows last year, and finished 2003 on top of the ATP Tour rankings.

Roddick won 121 of his 147 matches while working with Gilbert, and said he had enjoyed their time together.
