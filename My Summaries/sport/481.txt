He won his first Grand Slam event at Flushing Meadows last year, and finished 2003 on top of the ATP Tour rankings.

Andy Roddick has ended an 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert which yielded the US Open title and saw the American become world number one.

He went on to win the US Open and four other titles for the year.

"The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time," said Roddick.

Federer, who has not had a coach since he split from Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick to win the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals.
