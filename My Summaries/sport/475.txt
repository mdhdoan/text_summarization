Agassi was serving at 5-6 down in the first set to fellow American Andy Roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match.

Agassi, who has won the Australian Open four times, will have an MRI scan to discover the extent of the damage.

He said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss Wimbledon last year.

Andre Agassi's involvement in the Australian Open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the Kooyong Classic with a hip injury.

Time will shortly tell if it (the Australian Open) is a possibility or not.
