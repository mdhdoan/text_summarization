Thanou, the 2000 Olympic women's 100m silver medallist, and Sydney 200m champion Kenteris were suspended by the IAAF for missing three drugs tests.

Katerina Thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter Kostas Kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.

The Greek pair appeared at a hearing on Saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics' ruling body the IAAF should stand.

The third was supposed to take place on the eve of the Athens Games last August, but the pair could not be found in the athletes' village.

Thanou's coach Christos Tzekos was also suspended by the IAAF.
