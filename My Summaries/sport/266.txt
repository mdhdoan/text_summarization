The Real Madrid striker has been linked with a move to Anfield since the summer and is currently behind Raul, Ronaldo and Michael Owen at the Bernabeu.

The fee could put Liverpool off a prospective deal but Real are keen to net the cash as they are reported to be preparing a massive summer bid for Inter Milan striker Adriano.

Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez is keen to bolster his forward options with Djibril Cisse out until next season.

The Reds are currently sixth in the Premiership, 15 points behind leaders Chelsea.

Liverpool may launch an Â£8m January bid for long-time target Fernando Morientes, according to reports.
