The Six Nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and Wales and Ireland rather than traditional big guns France and England face a potential Grand Slam play-off in three weeks' time.

Coach Andy Robinson, who took over from the successful Sir Clive Woodward in September, has lost a phalanx of World Cup stars.

England sat on rugby's summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 Grand Slam winners.

Wales' most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last Grand Slam success came in 1978 in the era of Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett, JPR Williams et al.

Welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the Celtic showdown to crown their Grand Slam.
