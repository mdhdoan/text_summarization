Gardener, part of the Great Britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the Athens Olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekend's Norwich Union European Indoor trials in Sheffield.

, who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent.

The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second.

The 24-year-old reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former AAA champion Diane Allahgreen in the final.

Britain's Jason Gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at Sunday's Leipzig International meeting.
