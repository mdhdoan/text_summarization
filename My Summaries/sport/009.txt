That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorio's effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships.

Gardener, part of the Great Britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the Athens Olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekend's Norwich Union European Indoor trials in Sheffield.

, who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent.

Britain's Jason Gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at Sunday's Leipzig International meeting.

The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second.
