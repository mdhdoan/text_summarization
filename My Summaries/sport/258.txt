But the storm increased following racist chanting by Spanish fans at England's black players during the game, which Spain won 1-0.

England's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month.

Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry's Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive.

Spain's Football Federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach Luis Aragones over racist comments about Thierry Henry.

Spain's minister of sport Jaime Lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the Federation's decision.
