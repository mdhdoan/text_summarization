Italy coach John Kirwan believes his side can upset England as the Six Nations wooden spoon battle hots up.

England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson.

The two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of England's current slump.

"But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England."

Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory.
