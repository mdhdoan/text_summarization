England were beaten 11-9 by Wales in their Six Nations opener in Cardiff last week and face current champions France at Twickenham on Sunday.

Robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old Newcastle centre Mathew Tait, who made his international debut against Wales but has been demoted from the squad to face France.

But full-back Robinson believes the new-look England team can stop the rot against France.

England captain Jason Robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline.

England find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987.
