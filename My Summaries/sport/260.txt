Souness dropped Bellamy for Sunday's game against Arsenal, claiming the Welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position.

"I don't want the fans to think for one minute that I wouldn't play for this club," he said.

"At that meeting Bellamy admitted to Graeme and I that he had told the players that he was going to "fake" an injury in training and walk off.

"I'd play anywhere for this club, even in goal.

And the Wales international refused to apologise.
