Souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said Bellamy did not score enough goals "The chap that's just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren't even in the top flight," said Souness.

Earlier in the week, Souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after Bellamy accused him of lying.

"But if I'd been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job I have after Newcastle."

"That's not good enough for a striker at a club like this.

"We need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis."
