Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.

Then just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens and withdrew from the Games.

The Greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens.

The IAAF issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be.

All athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times, so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests.
