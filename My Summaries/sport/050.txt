The Greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens.

Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.

Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

Then just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens and withdrew from the Games.

All athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times, so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests.
