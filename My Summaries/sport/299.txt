England coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.

Robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to England's future.

Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour.

Lock Ben Kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere England positives were thin on the ground.

He missed a tackle on Michael Owen in the build-up to Wales' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled Gavin Henson's cross-kick into touch, all inside the first quarter.
