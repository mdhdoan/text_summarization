The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term.

Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager Craig Brown.

"He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football.

"On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football."

Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts' assistant Tommy Burns.
