As well as being hit with the ban, Collins was stripped of her 2003 world and US indoor 200m titles.

Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation.

The 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.

She is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use.

The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport.
