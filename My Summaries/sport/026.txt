She is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use.

Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation.

As well as being hit with the ban, Collins was stripped of her 2003 world and US indoor 200m titles.

The 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.

The company has been accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes.
