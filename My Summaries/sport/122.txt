Brentford face a home tie against holders Manchester United in the FA Cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against Southampton.

Bolton host Arsenal or Sheffield United and Leicester will visit the winners of the Burnley and Blackburn replay.

The League One side held the Saints at St Mary's in their fifth-round tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against Sir Alex Ferguson's side.

"It is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way Brentford came back at us on Saturday and the fact that United have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive.

"But I've been drawn against United so many times in cups and beaten them at both Bournemouth and West Ham.
