"I think England would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards.

Leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for Andy Farrell should the Great Britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes.

Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game.

"At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement."

Farrell, who has had persistent knee problems, had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months.
