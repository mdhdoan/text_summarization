With Arsenal hit by injuries and suspension, inexperienced midfield pair of Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas will line up against Rosenborg but Wenger is confident they will prove more than capable.

The Gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender Sol Campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club.

Almunia will start Tuesday's Champions League group tie against Rosenborg and is likely to face Chelsea on Sunday.

And the 30-year-old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve Champions League success with Arsenal.

Henry will captain the side in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira as the Gunners seek the required victory over Rosenborg.
