Almunia will start Tuesday's Champions League group tie against Rosenborg and is likely to face Chelsea on Sunday.

And the 30-year-old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve Champions League success with Arsenal.

Meanwhile, Thierry Henry believes he will be blamed if Arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League.

The Gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender Sol Campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club.

Arsene Wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper Manuel Almunia for the crunch week which could define Arsenal's season.
