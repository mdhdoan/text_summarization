Davies, one of the stars of Saturday's RBS Six Nations win over England, is only on a year contract at Kingsholm.

Wales hooker Mefin Davies is likely to stay with English side Gloucester despite reported interest from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.

But the hooker has proved his worth to the Zurich Premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season.
