Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club.

The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare," he said.

"Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club."

If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season," he said.

"It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive," added Robertson.
