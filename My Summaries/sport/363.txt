Former Scotland international Finlay Calder fears civil war at the SRU could seriously hamper his country's RBS Six Nations campaign.

"In fact, I don't understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived.

Mackay's executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee, which contains members elected by Scotland's club sides.
