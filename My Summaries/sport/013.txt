The 29-year-old would be a strong contender at the event in France and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the 32-strong squad.

The 29-year-old took part in the 2002 and 2003 London Marathons and was edged out by Radcliffe in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.

The two-time world half-marathon silver medallist will be back to challenge Radcliffe at this year's London event in April.

The Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month's world cross country championships.

"I will be disappointed if I am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships."
