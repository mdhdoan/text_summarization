Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said he has no regrets after his second-string side lost 3-0 away at Fenerbahce in the Champions League.

"We could get Inter, AC Milan and Juventus but Bayern, Barcelona and Real Madrid were among the runners-up.

Ferguson said: "The good thing about being manager is that you are in control of which team to pick.

"I care about United, that's important, so while I am disappointed at the result I am not at the team I selected.

Ferguson admitted his side were well-beaten by the Turks, a result which meant they finished second in Group D behind Lyon.
