England prop Phil Vickery is staying positive despite a broken arm ruling him out of the RBS Six Nations.

The 28-year-old fractured the radius in his right forearm during Gloucester's 17-16 win over Bath on Saturday.

After the game, Vickery spoke with Bath prop David Barnes, who also broke his arm recently.

He really needed 80 minutes of rugby this weekend, and then this happened.

Gloucester director of rugby Nigel Melville said: "Phil has broken his radius, which is the large bone in his forearm.
