England prop Phil Vickery is staying positive despite a broken arm ruling him out of the RBS Six Nations.

He really needed 80 minutes of rugby this weekend, and then this happened.

After the game, Vickery spoke with Bath prop David Barnes, who also broke his arm recently.

The 28-year-old fractured the radius in his right forearm during Gloucester's 17-16 win over Bath on Saturday.

"I don't really know how it happened, but Phil will definitely be out of action for at least six weeks.
