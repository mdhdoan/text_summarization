Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.

Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season.

On Tuesday, Morientes had said: "I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me.

But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool.

Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to Â£5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.
