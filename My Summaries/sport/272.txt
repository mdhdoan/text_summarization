Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.

On Tuesday, Morientes had said: "I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me.

Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season.

Liverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week.

Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.
