He has confirmed his participation in the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February, where he will take on another member of Britain's victorious men's relay team - Jason Gardener - over 60m.

Mark Lewis-Francis says his Olympic success has made him determined to bag World Championship 100m gold in 2005.

The 22-year-old pipped Maurice Greene on the last leg of the 4x100m relay in Athens to take top honours for Team GB.

He added: "It's a bit too early to make any predictions for Helsinki, but I have my eyes open and I know I can be the best in the world."

"The gold medal in Athens has made me realise that I can get to the top level and I want to get there again.
