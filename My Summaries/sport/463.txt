The 18-year-old wild card won three of the four junior Grand Slam events last year, including Wimbledon.

Roger Federer plays Greg Rusedski in the second round on Wednesday.

Monfils, who was given a wildcard into the tournament, said: "This is my first win over a top 10 player and I am delighted.

"I play my best tennis when I am fired up on the court and the reason I won today was because I was able to play my natural, attacking game," he said.

French prodigy Gael Monfils underlined his huge promise by beating French Open champion Gaston Gaudio 6-4 7-6 (7-4) in the first round of the Qatar Open.
