"What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say," Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday.

The company is 85% owned by the government and 15% by its staff.

Three senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest.

This week opposition politicians had called on the Irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline.

The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus.
