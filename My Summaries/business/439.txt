Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.

Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs.

Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.

Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said.
