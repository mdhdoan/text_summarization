The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday.

Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.

Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs.

Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption.

Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.
