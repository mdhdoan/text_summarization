Mr Glazer's financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they won't back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club's shares.

Mr Glazer got permission to look at the club's accounts last week.

However, there has been much speculation that the Irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough.

The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph say they will oppose any formal Â£800m takeover bid from US tycoon Malcom Glazer.

Mr Magnier and Mr McManus issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained "long-term investors" in Man Utd.
