Mr Glazer's financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they won't back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club's shares.

Mr Glazer got permission to look at the club's accounts last week.

Mr Glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003.

Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier, who own a 29% stake in Manchester United, will reportedly reject any formal Â£800m offer for the club.

The Sunday Telegraph says the board of Manchester United also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it.
