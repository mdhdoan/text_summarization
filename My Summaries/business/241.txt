The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in April.

Talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of China and India, the US budget and trade deficits, how the US, Europe and Japan can act to boost global economic growth, and HIV/Aids.

G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.

But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown's International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries.

Representatives from China, India, Russia, South Africa and Brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions.
