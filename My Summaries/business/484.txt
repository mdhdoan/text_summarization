UK young top Euro earnings league

British teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries, are the most keen to use make-up products.

British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests.

And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.

Children in the UK between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of Â£775, said market analyst Datamonitor.
