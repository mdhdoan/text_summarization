The board hopes the move will reverse a 13% fall in Reliance's shares since the feud became public last month.

The company plans to buy back 52 million shares at 570 rupees (Â£6.80; $13) apiece, a premium of more than 10% to its current market price.

The company has been fractious since founder Dhirubhai Ambani died in 2002, leaving no will.

The board of Indian conglomerate Reliance has agreed a share buy-back, to counter the effects of a power struggle in the controlling family.

"Today's round has gone to [Mukesh], there is no doubt about it," said Nanik Rupani, president of the Indian Merchants Chamber, a Bombay-based traders' body.
