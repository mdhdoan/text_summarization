Chrysler avoided the fate of US rivals Ford and General Motors, both of whom lost ground to Japanese firms.

Sales totalled 3.9 million units worldwide during 2004, the company said at the Detroit Motor Show.

US-German carmaker DaimlerChrysler has sold 2.1% more cars in 2004 than in the previous year, as solid Chrysler sales offset a weak showing for Mercedes.

In Europe, the Smart will now go on sale through regular Mercedes dealerships as well as its own dealer network, Mr Cordes said.

Its sales rose 3.5% to 2.7 million units.
