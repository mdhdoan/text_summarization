The sale is a further move by Citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service - insurance, broking and banking.

"This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution," said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.

Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years.

Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m.

For Metlife, the US's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.
