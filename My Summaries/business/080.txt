President Chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a South American oil company, which could include the state-owned companies of Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia.

Under this deal, the Argentine market will be opened to Venezuelan investment.

Argentina and Venezuela have extended a food-for-oil deal, which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year.

Argentina fears that rising demand could spark another crisis and wants to prevent it by signing this deal.

The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa.
