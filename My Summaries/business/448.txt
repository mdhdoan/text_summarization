Ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across Europe.

The nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to Ahold, are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores.

Ahold hit the headlines in February 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US subsidiary Foodservice.

The suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its earnings.

At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen by many as Europe's Enron.
