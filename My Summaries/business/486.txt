Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive.

The ongoing public spat between the two heirs of India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Group, has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.

The IPCL board met in Mumbai to discuss the company's results for the October-to-December quarter.

On Wednesday, the board of Reliance Energy, another Reliance Group company, reaffirmed its faith in Anil, who is the company's chief.

Mukesh is the company's chairman and Anil its deputy, and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting.
