Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive.

The ongoing public spat between the two heirs of India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Group, has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.

The move follows a decision earlier this month by Anil - the younger brother of Reliance Group president Mukesh Ambani - to resign from his post.

The IPCL board met in Mumbai to discuss the company's results for the October-to-December quarter.

Mukesh is the company's chairman and Anil its deputy, and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting.
