Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said.

Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

A weekend report in the Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse's offer.

Last week, the group rejected a Â£1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from Deutsche Boerse, claiming that it undervalued the business.

There has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with Deutsche Boerse failed in 2000.
