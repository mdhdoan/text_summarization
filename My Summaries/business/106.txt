Gordon Brown's decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a "sensible thing to do", since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC.Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions.Formerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March.Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising.Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.
