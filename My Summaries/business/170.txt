UK house prices fell 0.7% in December, according to figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

The average UK house price fell from £180,126 in November to £178,906, reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004.

December is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of Christmas celebrations.
