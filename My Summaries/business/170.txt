After registering falls at the back-end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.

However, recent figures from the Land Registry - showing a big drop in sales between the last quarter of 2004 and the previous year - suggested the slowdown could be more than a seasonal blip.

The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003, the Land Registry said.

UK house prices fell 0.7% in December, according to figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

All major UK regions, apart from Northern Ireland, experienced a fall in annual growth during December.
