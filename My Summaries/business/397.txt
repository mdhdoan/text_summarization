The UK government will soon require all quoted companies to report their social and environmental risks in a chapter in their annual reports, called the Operating and Financial Review.

Peter Knight, director of Context, says 24 UK top 250 companies reported for the first time this year and, in general, the quality of reports has improved.

Nearly 20% more UK top 250 firms produced non-financial reports on social and environment issues than last year.

The majority of European top 50 companies (44) publish them and only 27 of the US top 50.

The US seems to lag Europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports.
