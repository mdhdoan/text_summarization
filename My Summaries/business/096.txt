The company successfully bid for the two contracts, granted by government owned oil firms, covering onshore and offshore areas in the Gulf of Suez.

The firm, which floated in 2003, recently announced a deal to buy 26% of Indian firm Hindustan Oil Exploration.

"These assets significantly increase our exploration portfolio in Egypt and we continue to investigate further opportunities in this region," said chief executive Finian O'Sullivan.

The Â£13.8m deal gives Burren Energy access to the Indian oil and gas industry.

Burren Energy already has a presence in Egypt, having been awarded an exploration contract last year.
