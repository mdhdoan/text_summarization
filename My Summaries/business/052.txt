Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; Â£4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome.

At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards.

The government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population.

Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt.
