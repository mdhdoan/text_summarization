Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome.

Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; Â£4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend.

Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt.

The government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population.

The government has been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to a "brain-drain" of the country's brightest talents.
