The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.

Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece.

From 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products.

The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name.

The case will also have a major impact on Britain's sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.
