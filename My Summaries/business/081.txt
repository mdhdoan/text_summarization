When asked if BMW would be seeking compensation from Bosch, the carmaker's chief executive Helmut Panke said: "we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay".

The faulty part does not represent a safety risk and the recall only affects pumps made in December and January.

The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part.

Bosch has stopped production of the part but expects to restart by 2 February.

A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production.
