Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.

Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears.

The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.

Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.

The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy.
