In the Ukraine earlier this year, Mr Soros - who took on the Bank of England in the 1990s - and won, was pelted by protestors.

"This legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan to cease its activities in Kazakhstan and shut its doors for Kazakh citizens and organisations," the OSI said.

A demand for unpaid taxes and fines of $600,000 (Â£425,000) is politically motivated, the OSI claimed, adding that it paid the money in October.

The government controls the printing presses and most radio and TV transmission facilities.

It operates the country's national radio and TV networks.
