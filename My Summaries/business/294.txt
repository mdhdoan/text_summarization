Elsewhere in the financial markets on Wednesday, the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen, while US oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in New York.

The rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that President Bush is less likely than Mr Kerry to release supplies from the US' strategic oil reserve.

The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush's victory in the presidential elections.

Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy.

In key swing states such as Ohio, which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years, President Bush's handling of the economy became a crucial election issue.
