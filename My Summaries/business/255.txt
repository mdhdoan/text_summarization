The think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission's initial report into UK retirement savings.

The report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the UK pension crisis.

According to the Pensions Commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement.

The PPI added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions.

As a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of UK pensioners.
