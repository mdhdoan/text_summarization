Economists point out that whatever Europe says, in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to President George W Bush's administration.

It rallied briefly on Monday amid signs that oil prices are easing.

The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was "in America's interest".

"If the imbalances in the US economy are not adjusted in the future, the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks."

Not only does it boost US exports, but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund.
