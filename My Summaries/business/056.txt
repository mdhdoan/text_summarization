China remains the main area of concern for BMW after sales there fell 16% last year.

The luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce - in Asia last year after the launch of three new models.

However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends.

The company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in China in 2003.

The German carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in Asia to 150,000 by 2008.
