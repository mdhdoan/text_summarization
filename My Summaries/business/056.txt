China remains the main area of concern for BMW after sales there fell 16% last year.

The luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce - in Asia last year after the launch of three new models.

However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends.

The company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in China in 2003.

"Here in Asia, we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features," said Helmut Panke, BMW's group chief executive.
