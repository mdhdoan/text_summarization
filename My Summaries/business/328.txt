The US budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red, helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy.

US president George W Bush has pledged to introduce a "tough" federal budget next February in a bid to halve the country's deficit in five years.

Mr Bush, however, has said the best way to halt the dollar's slide is to deal with the US deficit.

The federal budget deficit hit a record $412bn (Â£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 September and $377bn in the previous year.

But the dollar's weakness has hit European and Asian exporters and lead to calls for US intervention to boost the currency.
