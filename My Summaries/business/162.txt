Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.

Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say.

Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.

The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest.

The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn.
