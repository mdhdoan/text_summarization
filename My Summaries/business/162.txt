Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.

Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say.

Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.

The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest.

Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs.
