The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright.

It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; Â£1.05bn) settlement with GM about Fiat's ownership.

Ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat's carmaking operations, the Financial Times has reported.

Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.

Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business.
