Ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat's carmaking operations, the Financial Times has reported.

The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright.

Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969.

It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; Â£1.05bn) settlement with GM about Fiat's ownership.

Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.
