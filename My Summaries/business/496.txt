Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week.

European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.

China is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar.

But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.

Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros.
