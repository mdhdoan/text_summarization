Sales of stakes in firms including Russia's OAO Mobile Telesystems raised 1.17bn euros.

German telecoms firm Deutsche Telekom saw strong fourth quarter profits on the back of upbeat US mobile earnings and better-than-expected asset sales.

Sales rose 2.8% to 14.96bn euros.

Net profit came in at 1.4bn euros (Â£960m; $1.85bn), a dramatic change from the loss of 364m euros in 2003.

The company also said it would resume paying a dividend, after two years in which it focused on cutting debt.
