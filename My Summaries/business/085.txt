The number of mortgages approved in the UK has risen for the first time since May last year, according to lending figures from the Bank of England.

"The modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in December reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply," said Global Insight analyst Howard Archer, commenting on the BoE's figures.

Changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in November, thus flattering the December figures, analysts said.

Separately, the Bank of England said that consumer credit rose by £1.5bn in December, more than the £1.4bn expected and above the £1.4bn reported in the previous month.

In October last year, new rules came into force, which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in November and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly.
