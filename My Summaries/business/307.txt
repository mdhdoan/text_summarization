Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.

Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe.

Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year.

Cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract.

The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day.
