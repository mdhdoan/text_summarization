But, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle "yawning deficits".

A survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%.

"With figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes."

Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities.

Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more, IDS said.
