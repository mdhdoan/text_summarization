Analysts see two spurs to future growth as being China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower trade tariffs.

China overtook the US to become Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, according to numbers released by Japan's Finance Ministry on Wednesday.

China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the US.

In 2004, Japan's imports from and exports to China (and Hong Kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;Â£114.5bn).

On Tuesday, figures showed China's economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong.
