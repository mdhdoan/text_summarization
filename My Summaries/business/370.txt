The ISM manufacturing index's main sister survey - the employment index - eased to 52.7 in December from 57.6 in November, while its "prices paid" index, measuring the cost to businesses of their inputs, also eased to 72.0 from 74.0.

The ISM's index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from monthly responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies, ranging from textiles to chemicals to paper, and has now been above 50 since June 2003.

Analysts expected December's figure to come in at 58.1.

The result for December was slightly better than analysts' expectations and the 19th consecutive expansion.

The ISM said the growth was driven by a "significant" rise in the new orders.
