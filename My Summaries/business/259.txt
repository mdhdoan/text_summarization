ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years.

Doubts about the strength of the US recovery and overheating of the Chinese economy do however pose risks for 2005.

Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products.

Latin America's economy grew by 5.5% in 2004, its best performance since 1980, while exports registered their best performance in two decades.

Strong recovery in some countries, such as Venezuela and Uruguay, boosted the overall performance of the region.
