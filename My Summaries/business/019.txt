Investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that India's mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007.

India has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.

"It is a positive development for carriers and the investment community, looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the Indian telecoms market," said Gartner's principal analyst Kobita Desai.

The government hopes to increase the number of mobile users from 95 million to between 200 and 250 million by 2007.

The Indian mobile market is currently dominated by four companies, Bharti Televentures which has allied itself with Singapore Telecom, Essar which is linked with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, the Sterling group and the Tata group.
