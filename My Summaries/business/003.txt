State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.

Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm.

"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets," said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.

Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.

Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.
