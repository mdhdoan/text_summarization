"Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006," NIESR said, adding that "the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery".

The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its "golden rule", a report suggests.

The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan.

Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.

It claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts.
