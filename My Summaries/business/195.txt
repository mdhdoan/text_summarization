It said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the "world economy will continue to grow strongly".

"Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006," NIESR said, adding that "the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery".

The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan.

Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.

The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its "golden rule", a report suggests.
