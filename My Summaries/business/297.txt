Its profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the United States - the bank's largest single market - following recent interest rate rises.

Deutsche Bank said earlier this month it would reduce its German workforce by 1,920 while as many as 300 jobs will be lost at Credit Suisse First Boston.

The bank said it was on course for a 10% rise in net income this year but operating profits are set to fall because of a fall in US revenues.

ABN Amro is the third large European bank to announce cutbacks in the past month following Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse Group.

Jobs will also be lost in the US - which accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across its operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.
