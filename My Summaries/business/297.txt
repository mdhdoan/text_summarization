The bank said it was on course for a 10% rise in net income this year but operating profits are set to fall because of a fall in US revenues.

Its profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the United States - the bank's largest single market - following recent interest rate rises.

Jobs will also be lost in the US - which accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across its operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.

ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to cut 2,850 jobs as a result of falling profits.

"To get any profit growth in the coming years, they will have to lower costs, so shedding jobs makes total sense," Ivo Geijsen, an analyst with Bank Oyens & Van Eeghen, told Bloomberg.
