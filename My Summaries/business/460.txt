Hours before Friday's announcement, there was a funereal air at Peoplesoft's headquarters, reported AP news agency.

Oracle's 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times.

"By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months," Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.

In after-hours trading the shares did not move.

"The new company is going to be totally different," said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesoft's director of database markets.
