The Netherlands-based company is due to complete its $4.5bn acquisition of US firm ISG next month, making it one of the largest global firms of its kind.

Mr Mittal told US investors that once the acquisition of International Steel Group was completed, the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 annually.

Mittal Steel, one of the world's largest steel producers, could cut up to 45,000 jobs over the next five years, its chief executive has said.

However, Lakshmi Mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs.

A combination of Mittal Steel and ISG would have annual sales of $32bn (Â£16.7bn; 24.1bn euros) and a production capacity of 70 million tonnes.
