As well as strong domestic demand, exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year.

Despite the concerns, analysts pointed out that France was outperforming the majority of its European counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years.

France's economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004, driven by consumer spending, a report shows.

That expansion pushed annual growth to 2.3%, the fastest rate in two years.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period, the statistical office INSEE said.
