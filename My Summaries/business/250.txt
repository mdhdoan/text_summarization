Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK$327m (US$42m; Â£22m), less than 1% up on the year before.

But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn.

The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market.

The reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent Lenovo's shares up 6% in late January.

The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM.
