Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer.

At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United's second biggest shareholders.

Earlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club.

In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer "limited due diligence" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid.

"The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive," the statement said, "and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging."
