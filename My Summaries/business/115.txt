Cheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and Wellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up 1% in 2004.

Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over £1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business.

GlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to £6.2bn ($11.5bn), but Europe's biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way.

The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver profits despite the failure of an obesity drug.

However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as '771, after disappointing clinical trial results.
