Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants.

Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers.

Mr Sullivan, WorldCom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers.

Former WorldCom boss Bernie Ebbers was directly involved in the $11bn financial fraud at the firm, his closest associate has told a US court.

Mr Sullivan is at the centre of the government's case against Mr Ebbers.
