Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants.

Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers.

Mr Sullivan, WorldCom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers.

Mr Sullivan is at the centre of the government's case against Mr Ebbers.

Giving evidence in the criminal trial of Mr Ebbers, ex-finance chief Scott Sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm.
