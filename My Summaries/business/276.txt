The 865 million share offer, a mix of new shares and sales by the government, raised 54bn rupees($1.2bn).

NTPC has said it will use the money from the share sale to feed the growing needs of the country's energy-starved economy.

The government's partial sell-off of NTPC is part of a controversial programme to privatise state-run firms.

The firm is the largest utility company in India, and the sixth largest power producer in the world.

Shares in India's largest power producer, National Thermal Power Corp (NTPC) have risen 13% on their stock market debut.
