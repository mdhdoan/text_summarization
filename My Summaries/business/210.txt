The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.

At their meeting in London, G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries.

The plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend.

The US, which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.

By revaluing its holdings, the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations.
