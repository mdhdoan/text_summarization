Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.

Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke.

However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal.

Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder.

China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom.
