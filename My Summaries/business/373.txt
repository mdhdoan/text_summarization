Shares of Skis Rossignol, the world's largest ski-maker, have jumped as much as 15% on speculation that it will be bought by US surfwear firm Quiksilver.

European sporting goods companies have seen foreign revenues squeezed by a slump in the value of the US dollar, making a takeover more attractive, analysts said.

Rossignol shares touched 17.70 euros, before falling back to trade 7.8% higher at 16.60 euros.

Companies such as Quiksilver would be able to cut costs by selling Rossignol skis through their shops, they added.

Analysts believe other sporting goods companies may now take a closer look at Rossignol, prompting an auction and pushing the sale price higher.
