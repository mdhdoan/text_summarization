Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure.

Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting.

The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015.

A levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world's poorest nations.

It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the "competitiveness of the airlines".
