European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.

Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure.

The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015.

Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting.

The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines.
