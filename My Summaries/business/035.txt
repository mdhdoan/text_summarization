Chief Executive Martin Sorrell on Friday told Reuters news agency that WPP had submitted a proposal for United Business Media's NOP World market research unit.

The long-term outlook looks "very favourable" because of media and technology developments and the strength of the US economy, WPP said.

During the year WPP bought US rival Grey Global, creating a giant big enough to rival sector leader Omnicom.

Pre-tax profits rose 15% from a year ago to reach £546m ($1.04bn), ahead of average analysts' forecasts of £532m.

UK advertising giant WPP has posted larger-than-expected annual profits and predicted that it will outperform the market in 2005.
