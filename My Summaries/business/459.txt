It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.

The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment.

In its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a "golden period" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.

This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%.

"Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy," Mr Bootle.
