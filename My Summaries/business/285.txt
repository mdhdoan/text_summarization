Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says.

Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010.

In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010.

But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.

The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce.
