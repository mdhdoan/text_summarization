But despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; Â£154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market.

Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost.

Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called "beer-like" drinks is set to grow 84% this year.

Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt.

Japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows.
