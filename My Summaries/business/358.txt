German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US.

Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos.

Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset.

Deutsche Bank would have earned large fees from the deal, which could not be carried out because US chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the Kremlin's auction of Yuganskneftegas on 19 December illegal under US law.

Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and "we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again," he said.
