The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market.

Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices.

The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.

For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product.

Trade barriers and subsidies "severely" distort the market, the FAO report on the "State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004" said.
