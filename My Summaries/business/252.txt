The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from April in areas of high customer demand.

The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors "real equality of access to its phone lines".

"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT's local network," the former monopoly said in a statement.

Ofcom is expected to spend the next few weeks examining the proposals before making an announcement within the next few months.

More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase.
