Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand.

US light sweet crude futures jumped to $53.09 a barrel in New York before closing at $53.03.

"This market simply wants to go up," Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency.

Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: "Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast."

The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon.
