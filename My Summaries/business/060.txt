The investigation by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer has now obtained nine guilty pleas.

Mr Spitzer's investigation of the US insurance industry looked at whether companies rigged bids and fixed prices.

Another three US insurance executives have pleaded guilty to fraud charges stemming from an ongoing investigation into industry malpractice.

The highest ranking executive pleading guilty on Tuesday was former Marsh senior vice president Joshua Bewlay.

Last month Marsh agreed to pay $850m (Â£415m) to settle a lawsuit filed by Mr Spitzer, but under the settlement it "neither admits nor denies the allegations".
