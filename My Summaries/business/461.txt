"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable," said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper.

Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap.

Car ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on the city's roads.

The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic.

Unclogging Beijing's increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the Chinese authorities, who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games.
