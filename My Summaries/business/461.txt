Car ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on the city's roads.

Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap.

The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic.

It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds.

"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable," said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper.
