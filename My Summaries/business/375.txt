South Korea's stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.

The firm's creditors - which own 99% of LG Card - have been trying to agree a deal to secure its future for several weeks.

LG Card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country's economy.

LG Card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm's creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it.

"LG Card will not need any more financial aid after this," Laah Chong-gyu, executive director of Korea Development Bank - one of the firm's creditors - said.
