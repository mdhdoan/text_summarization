Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability.

Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales.

A combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish European economy has hit sales at Swiss food and drink giant Nestle.

Nestle's total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins.

Elsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an "exceptional" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth.
