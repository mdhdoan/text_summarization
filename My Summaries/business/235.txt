The PPI's estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.

"Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age," he said.

The government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies.

But if measured at age 65 instead, the PPI said, a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years.

Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years.
