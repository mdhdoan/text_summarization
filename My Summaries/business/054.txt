South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.

South Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010.

He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.

This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units.

Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.
