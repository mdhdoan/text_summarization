The former head of US medical services firm HealthSouth overstated earnings and assets to boost the company's share price, it was claimed in court.

Mr Scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the Sarbanes Oxley Act - a law introduced in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies' results.

After federal agents raided HealthSouth's offices in March 2003, the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on.

The firm has since reorganised its board and management team and currently operates about 1,400 health clinics.

Among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud, filing false statements and money laundering.
