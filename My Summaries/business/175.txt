Consumer spending fuelled France's economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy.

"It's a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price," Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency.

French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth, figures revealed.

According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December.

Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January.
