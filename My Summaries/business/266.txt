Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.

Since Yukos' founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the Russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.

The case against Yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed.

The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year.

Companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards.
