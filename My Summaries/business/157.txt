The company's effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas.

A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are "false".

Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill.

The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs.

Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the "running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction".
