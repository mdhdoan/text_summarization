Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves.

The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy.

Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs.

It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward.

The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%.
