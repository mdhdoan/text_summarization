Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.

Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness.

Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.

Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002.

Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.
