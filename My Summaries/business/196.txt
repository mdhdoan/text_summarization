The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss Bernie Ebbers.

Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.

Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002.

Attorney Reid Weingarten has attempted to portray Mr Sullivan as a liar and on Thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts' profit estimates.

Prosecutors allege that the company's top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period.
