According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is "kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies".

France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm.

News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market.

Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target.
