Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor.

Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand.

Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid.

Commission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; Â£275m) loan to the carrier.

The matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia.
