The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall.

The world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.

In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.

News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs).
