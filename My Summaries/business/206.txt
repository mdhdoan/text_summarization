It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004.

The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered.

Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly.

Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.

John Gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only "partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002".
