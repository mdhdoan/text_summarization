The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.

In addition, low interest rates meant that "long-term investment returns are well below historic levels", Mr Gill added.

The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered.

Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.

It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004.
