Next's like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year earlier.

Next's trading statement comes a day after House of Fraser and Woolworths disappointed investors with their figures.

Next chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were "below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be", but said sales should still top analyst expectations.

"Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations," the company said.

Mr Wolfson also said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were "more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn't there for the stock".
