"Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations," the company said.

Next's like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year earlier.

Next chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were "below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be", but said sales should still top analyst expectations.

Mr Wolfson also said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were "more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn't there for the stock".

Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period.
