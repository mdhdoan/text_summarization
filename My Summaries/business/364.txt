Analysts have seen SSL as a takeover target for years.

However the news sent shares in SSL, which also makes Scholl footwear, up more than 6%, or 16.75 pence to 293.5p.

A Financial Times report said business intelligence firm GPW was understood to be starting due diligence work on SSL International, for a corporate client.

The FT said most the high-profile firm that might woo SSL was Anglo-Dutch household products group Reckitt Benckiser.

Other firms that have been seen as would-be suitors include Kimberly-Clark, Johnson & Johnson, and private equity investors.
