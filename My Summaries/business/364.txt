Analysts have seen SSL as a takeover target for years.

However the news sent shares in SSL, which also makes Scholl footwear, up more than 6%, or 16.75 pence to 293.5p.

Eighteen months ago Reckitt Benckiser was at the centre of a rumoured takeover bid for SSL - but that came to nothing.

The FT said most the high-profile firm that might woo SSL was Anglo-Dutch household products group Reckitt Benckiser.

A Financial Times report said business intelligence firm GPW was understood to be starting due diligence work on SSL International, for a corporate client.
