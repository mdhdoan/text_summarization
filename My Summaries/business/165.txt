Democrat challenger John Kerry has criticised President George W Bush's handling of the economy, pointing to a net loss of over 800,000 jobs since Mr Bush took office.

The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said.

However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth.

"It's a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York.

US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown.
