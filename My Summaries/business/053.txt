Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier.

"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005," chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning "to look beyond recovery to growth".

The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected "further gradual improvement" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales.

The company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from £3.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to £2.89bn in 2004.

Revenues at media group Reuters slipped 11% during 2004, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar, the group said.
