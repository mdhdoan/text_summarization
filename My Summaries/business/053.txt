The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected "further gradual improvement" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales.

"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005," chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning "to look beyond recovery to growth".

Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier.

The company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from £3.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to £2.89bn in 2004.

Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier.
