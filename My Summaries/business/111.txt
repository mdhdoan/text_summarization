Sales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3.4% In the US last year, revenue grew by 1.5% "despite disappointing sales in Slimfast", the company said.

The company also said it planned to spend 500m euros this year buying back shares.

Oil giant Shell last year dismantled its dual-ownership structure, after a series of problems relating to the size of its oil reserves that hammered its share price and led to the resignation of key board members.

The company said its main focus will be on improving profits, and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands.

Sales of Slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the Atkins diet.
