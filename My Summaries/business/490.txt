"The data is favourable, but a lot of jobs are temporary for the (Christmas) holiday season, so we may see slightly higher joblessness in January and February," Julio Hegedus, chief economist with Lopes Filho & Associates consultancy in Rio de Janeir, told Reuters news agency.

This improvement can be attributed to the country's strong economic growth, with the economy registering growth of 5.2% in 2004, the government said.

Brazil's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in three years in December, according to the government.

Despite his leftist background, President Lula has pursued a surprisingly conservative economic policy, arguing that in order to meet its social promises, the government needs to first reach a sustained economic growth.

The economy is expected to grow by about 4% this year.
