Exports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.

The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row.

China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington.

The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home.

According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn.
