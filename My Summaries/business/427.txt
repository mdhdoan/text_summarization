State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; Â£165bn).

Exports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.

The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row.

The US's overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.

The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home.
