"Vodafone is going to need to put a lot of money into Japan if it wants to rebuild the business," Tetsuro Tsusaka, a telecoms analyst with Deutsche Bank, told Reuters.

Mr Tsuda, who will become chairman, was appointed president only two months ago but the business has struggled since then, losing customers in January.

It suffered a net loss of more than 58,000 customers in January, its second monthly reverse in the last year.

Vodafone has drafted in its UK chief executive William Morrow to take charge of its troubled Japanese operation.

Mr Morrow will succeed Shiro Tsuda as president of Vodafone KK, Japan's number three mobile operator, in April.
