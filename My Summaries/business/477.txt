"The slavery era was a tragic time in US history and in our company's history."

The admission is part of an apology sent to JP Morgan staff after the bank researched its links to slavery in order to meet legislation in Chicago.

The bank said that it is a "very different company than the Citizens and Canal Banks of the 1800s".

Thousands of slaves were accepted as collateral for loans by two banks that later became part of JP Morgan Chase.

"We all know slavery existed in our country, but it is quite different to see how our history and the institution of slavery were intertwined," JP Morgan chief executive William Harrison and chief operating officer James Dimon said in the letter.
