Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles.

Analysts said that alliances with other carmakers would be a necessary part of whatever it came up with, not least because its own slow sales have left its manufacturing capacity under-used.

The US-German firm, once a majority shareholder, decided last April to stop providing financial backing.

Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler.

But a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Mitsubishi could end up building cars for PSA and perhaps its Japanese rival Nissan.
