The overall US economy has performed strongly in recent months, prompting the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates five times since June.

Consumers' confidence in the state of the US economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about 2005, an influential survey says.

According to figures also released on Tuesday, sales in shopping malls in the week to 25 December were 4.3% higher than in 2003 following a last minute rush.

Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has said its December sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-Christmas sales.

"And consumers' outlook suggests that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of next year."
