The move came after France and Germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the EU cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years.

It will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact rules.

Berlin welcomed the decision, with finance minister Hans Eichel saying it showed that the EC recognised Germany's fiscal policy was "on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions".

However Paris was more subdued, with finance minister Herve Gaymard telling parliament: "We must continue along this path of saving money."

The eurozone's two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in November 2003 when they persuaded fellow EU members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.
