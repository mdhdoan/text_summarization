The move came after France and Germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the EU cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years.

The eurozone's two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in November 2003 when they persuaded fellow EU members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.

The commission then took the pair to the European Court of Human Justice - which ruled EU countries could not put the pact "in abeyance", and confirmed the EC's right to launch "excessive debt procedures".

The forecasts are based on EC predictions of GDP growth of 1.5% in Germany next year and 2.2% in France.

After announcing its decision to erase France and Germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the EU said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%.
