France's second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; Â£2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros.

Strong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.

Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with particularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.

Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year.

"In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales," the company said in a statement.
