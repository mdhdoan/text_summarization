The Bank of England (BoE) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked.

In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years.

In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained "well contained" while the US economy appeared to be "growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices".

US firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in September.

The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy.
