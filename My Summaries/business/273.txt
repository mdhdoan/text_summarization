Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day.

At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency.

G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe.

Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.

Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns.
