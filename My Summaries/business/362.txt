Spending patterns for the year and estimates for December led Apacs to conclude that 10.38am was the time that plastic would finally rule the roost.

When the first plastic cards appeared in the UK in June 1966, issued by Barclaycard, but only a handful of retailers accepted them and very few customers held them.

"But in less than 40 years, plastic has become our most popular way to pay, due to the added security and flexibility it offers," said Apacs spokeswoman Jemma Smith.

Mrs Carroll was born in the same year that plastic cards first appeared in the UK.

Spending on credit and debit cards has overtaken cash spending in the UK for the first time.
