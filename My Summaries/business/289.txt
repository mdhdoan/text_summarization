The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August last year.

The group's quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years.

However, the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced "major risks" and warned that growth is set to slow.

"The pressure on costs and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems," BCC director general David Frost said.

Manufacturers' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found.
