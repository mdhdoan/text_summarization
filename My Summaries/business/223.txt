The sale of the US gaming unit will leave Wembley with its UK business.

BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a £308m takeover deal.

BLB's purchase of the US unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with Rhode Island authorities.

US gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (£182.5m) for the US unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions.

Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors.
