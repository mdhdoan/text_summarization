On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders' best interest to reject the offer.

Xstrata is a global mining giant with operations in Australia, South Africa, Spain, Germany, Argentina and the UK.

A report from investment firm Grant Samuel in WMC defence documents values WMC shares at A$7.17 to A$8.24, against Xstrata's bid of A$6.35 a share.

And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata's shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC's shareholders.

Marc Gonsalves, an executive at Xstrata, said: "We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so."
