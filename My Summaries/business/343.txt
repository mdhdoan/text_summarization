The Jamaican government is regaining control of Air Jamaica in an bid to help the ailing company out of its financial difficulties.

"The administration is committed to a viable national airline that will serve as a major catalyst for our economy," said Finance Minister Omar Davies.

The firm has failed to make money since the state sold a majority stake to hotel tycoon Gordon Stewart in 1994.

The 35-year-old airline transports about 55% of all passengers to the island and its pilots are reportedly among the best paid in the industry, with senior members of staff earning in excess of $234,000 a year.

The company will be restructured with the aim of finding a new buyer.
