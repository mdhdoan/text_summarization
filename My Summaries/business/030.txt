If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters," Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report.

A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said.

China's booming economy and a "spectacular comeback" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said.

The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.

Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.
