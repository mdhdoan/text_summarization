Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.

However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country's current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn.

However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter.

However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.

Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy.
