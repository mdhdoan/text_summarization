Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.

The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year.

Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy.

Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures.

However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter.
