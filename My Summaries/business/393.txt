Laura Ashley, which is due to issue its next trading statement in the next few weeks, has in recent months been hit by reports of poor sales.

In a statement issued on Thursday, Laura Ashley thanked Ms Mohd-Saaid for her services to the company.

In recent times, it has put renewed focus on home furnishings rather than clothing, but last September it reported that interim six month losses had risen from £1m to £1.2m, while sales had fallen from £138m to £118m.

Its shares were down 8.51% to 10.75p in late Thursday morning trading on the London Stock Exchange.

Ms Mohd-Saaid is to be replaced by Lillian Tan, presently a non-executive director of the company and head of a Malaysian retailer.
