Its shares were down 8.51% to 10.75p in late Thursday morning trading on the London Stock Exchange.

Laura Ashley, which floated on the London Stock Exchange for £200m ($376m) in 1995, is majority-owned by Malaysia entrepreneur Dr Khoo Kay Peng.

Laura Ashley, which is due to issue its next trading statement in the next few weeks, has in recent months been hit by reports of poor sales.

"Laura Ashley is a bit of a shrivelled husk of a company," said retail analyst Nick Bubb of Evolution Securities.

In recent times, it has put renewed focus on home furnishings rather than clothing, but last September it reported that interim six month losses had risen from £1m to £1.2m, while sales had fallen from £138m to £118m.
