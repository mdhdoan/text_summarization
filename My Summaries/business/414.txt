Before its collapse, the firm was the seventh biggest public US company by revenue.

The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of Enron's shareholders almost three years ago.

It joined the lawsuit in December 2001alleging "massive insider trading" and fraud, claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.

Enron's shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston.

Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.
