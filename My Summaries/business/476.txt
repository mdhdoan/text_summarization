The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector.

Saudi Arabia sold 7 million NCCI shares, or about 70% of the company's total capital last month.

Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale.

Shares in Saudi Arabia's National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) soared on their first day of trading in Riyadh.

However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance.
