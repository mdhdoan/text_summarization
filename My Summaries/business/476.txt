Saudi Arabia sold 7 million NCCI shares, or about 70% of the company's total capital last month.

The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector.

Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale.

Shares in Saudi Arabia's National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) soared on their first day of trading in Riyadh.

Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies.
