Members of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on Thursday.

After registering falls at the back end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.

However, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales.

The biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter.

The average house price in England and Wales was £182,920, down from £187,971 in July-September.
