"We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers," Mr Clarke said.

The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.

All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.

Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost.

New EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight.
