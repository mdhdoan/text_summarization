"We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over Â£1bn a year loaded onto European passengers," Mr Clarke said.

All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.

Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.

The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.

Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost.
