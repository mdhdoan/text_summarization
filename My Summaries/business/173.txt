It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its operating profits.

Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003.

Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in "aggressive" and "high-impact" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005.

However, it also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, imported brands.
