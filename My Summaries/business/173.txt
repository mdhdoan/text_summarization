Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year.

It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its operating profits.

Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003.

Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in "aggressive" and "high-impact" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005.

Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature.
