In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget.

"None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years," said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: "At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government."

After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about Â£400m.

The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years.
