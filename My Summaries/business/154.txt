In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget.

"None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years," said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: "At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government."

Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his "golden rule" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle.

The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual Â£10.5bn "black hole" in the nation's coffers.
