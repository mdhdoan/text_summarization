Judy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer.

Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had "fooled" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further.

She was leaving "by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities", the firm said in a statement.

The severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.

An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour.
