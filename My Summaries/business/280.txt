The unit was acquired by American Express 20 years ago as Investors Diversified Service, of Minneapolis, at a time when firms were amassing one-stop financial empires.

The US credit card to travel services giant said off-loading American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) would boost its profitability.

"This is an excellent move by American Express to focus on its core businesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for quite some time," said Marquis Investment Research analyst Phil Kain.

Over the years it has delivered poor profits and even some losses.

However, the business of selling investments was never integrated with the rest of the group.
