Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.

At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.

"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card," said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.

The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running.

The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said.
