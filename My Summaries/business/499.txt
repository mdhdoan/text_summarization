The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares.

Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources.

The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.

The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years.

Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy.
