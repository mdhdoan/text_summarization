Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos, a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.

Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block.

International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russia's decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005.

Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France's Total, the US-based ChevronTexaco, and miner Barrick Gold.

A number of other nations, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, protect their national resources from foreign firms.
