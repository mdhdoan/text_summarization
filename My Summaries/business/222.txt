Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos, a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.

The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russia's competition law, natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block.

A number of other nations, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, protect their national resources from foreign firms.

The Federal Natural Resources Agency said "the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources".
