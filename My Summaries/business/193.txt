Stephen Schechter, a UK investment banker who has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a possible bond sale, said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.

Shares in Borussia Dortmund, Germany's only stock-market listed football club, dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.

Fund manager Florian Hamm - Borussia Dortmund's largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run.

The company's shares tumbled after it said it has "entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation".

Borussia Dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; Â£47m) in the 12 months through June.
