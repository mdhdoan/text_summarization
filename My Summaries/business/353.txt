The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.

The worst-hit areas are Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, with at least 23,000 people killed.

Many of the worst-hit areas, such as Sri Lanka, Thailand's Phuket island and the Maldives, are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.

Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support, while Indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from IMF assistance.

"Arrivals to other destinations such as... Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived."
