The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.

This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come.

That long trough "might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates.

But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived.

The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares.
