The government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat.

The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country.

Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy.

Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.

The figures topped analysts expectations, even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003.
