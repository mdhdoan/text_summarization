Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.

The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.

Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries.

The government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat.

Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy.
