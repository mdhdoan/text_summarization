News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday, but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.

Shares in struggling German football club Borussia Dortmund slipped on Monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday.

The club, which has posted record losses and racked up debts, said last week that it was in "a life-threatening profitability and financial situation".

The club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through June.

Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run.
