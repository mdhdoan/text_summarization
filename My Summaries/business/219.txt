Shares in struggling German football club Borussia Dortmund slipped on Monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday.

News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday, but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.

The club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through June.

The club, which has posted record losses and racked up debts, said last week that it was in "a life-threatening profitability and financial situation".

Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club.
