AT&T is a long-distance telecoms firm, while SBC is mainly focused on the local market in the western US.

It effectively marks the end of AT&T, which was founded in 1875 by telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell and is one of the US's best-known companies.

The deal will be financed with $15bn of shares as well as a $1bn special dividend paid to AT&T shareholders.

The companies said they expected to complete the agreement during the first half of 2006.

US phone company SBC Communications said it expects to cut around 12,800 jobs following its $16bn (Â£8.5bn) takeover of former parent AT&T.
