"Money has moved out from India in the first two or three weeks of January into other markets like Korea and Thailand and this upgrade should lead to a reversal."

The rupee climbed to 43.305 per US dollar on Thursday, up from a close of 43.41.

India's rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised the country's foreign currency rating.

"The upgrade is positive and basically people will use it as an excuse to come back to India," said Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS.

With Indian assets now seen as less of a gamble, more cash is expected to flow into its markets, buoying the rupee.
