The rupee climbed to 43.305 per US dollar on Thursday, up from a close of 43.41.

"Money has moved out from India in the first two or three weeks of January into other markets like Korea and Thailand and this upgrade should lead to a reversal."

India's rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised the country's foreign currency rating.

"The upgrade is positive and basically people will use it as an excuse to come back to India," said Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS.

S&P, which rates borrowers' creditworthiness, lifted India's rating by one notch to 'BB+'.
