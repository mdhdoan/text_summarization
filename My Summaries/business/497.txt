The Egyptian-born analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks, prosecutors said.

One of the more bizarre aspects of the trial focused on the claims that Mr Elgindy may have had foreknowledge of the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.

A New York court ruled that former FBI man Jeffrey Royer, 41, fed damaging information to Anthony Elgindy, 36.

"Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI's crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public," said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf.

"Elgindy's conviction marks the end of his public charade as a crusader against fraud in the market," said Ms Mauskopf.
