There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year.

European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.

It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.

The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.

The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
