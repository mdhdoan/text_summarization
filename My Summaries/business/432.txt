"The decision to suspend flights between the UK and Saudi Arabia is a difficult one to make as we have enjoyed a long history of flying between the two countries," said BA director of commercial planning, Robert Boyle.

It suspended flights to Saudi Arabia for three weeks in autumn 2003 after a government warning about a "threat to UK aviation interests in Saudi Arabia".

"However, the routes don't currently make a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain them while this remains the case."

The airline said the decision was a commercial one due to reduced passenger demand for the services.

BA currently operates four flights per week from Heathrow to Jeddah, and three weekly journeys to Riyadh.
