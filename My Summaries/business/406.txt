US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales.

The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.

Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year.

Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier.

Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period.
