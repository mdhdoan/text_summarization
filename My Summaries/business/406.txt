The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.

Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period.

US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales.

Accessory vendor Claire's Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year.

Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year.
