In the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said.

And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.

Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said.

Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier.

But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.
