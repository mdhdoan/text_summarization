Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced.

Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.

The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was "in America's interest".

Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar's slide "brutal" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth.

But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant.
