The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to hold membership talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan.

China's admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with Russia and Saudi Arabia have been taking place for 10 years.

But several nations criticised the approach, and European Union ambassador to the WTO, Carlo Trojan, said Iran's application "must be treated independently of political issues".

Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move, describing it as significant as November's decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80% of the country's debts.

But Iran's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its application for the 21st time.
