Phytopharm shares jumped 10.7% on the news, with analysts saying sales of $600m (Â£309m) a year were possible.

Under the deal, production of the Hoodia cactus at Phytopharm's nursery in South Africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions, said Phytopharm chief executive Richard Dixey.

A slimming aid made from a southern African cactus is set to be developed by UK firm Phytopharm and Unilever.

The firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from Hoodia with Pfizer.

"This deal goes a long way to restoring the market faith in Phytopharm's pipeline after the Pfizer exit," said analyst Erling Refsum at Nomura.
