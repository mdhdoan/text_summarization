Oil prices recovered in Asian trade on Tuesday, after falling in New York on milder winter weather across the US.

With milder temperatures expected to continue in the northern parts of the US over the next few days at least, analysts have said the price of oil may fall further - even if the decline was only temporary.

Prices rose last week after militant attacks in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, briefly renewed fears that the supply chain might be broken in the world's leading crude exporter.

With winter temperatures staying relatively high in the northern US, a barrel of light crude ended Monday down $1.33 to $42.12.

"Weather has been the Achilles' heel of this market," said ABN AMRO analyst John Brady.
