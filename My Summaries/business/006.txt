Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.

"I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully," said economy minister Heizo Takenaka.

Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter.

A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.

On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought.
