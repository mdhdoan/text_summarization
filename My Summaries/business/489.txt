The deal saw the sale of 11bn euros ($14.4bn; Â£7.6bn) of government bonds in a few minutes on 2 August, with 4bn euros-worth then bought back later.

Traders at US banking giant Citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in Germany over a controversial bond deal.

Its private banking operation in Japan was closed down by regulators in Tokyo after an "aggressive sales culture" led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.

The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation.

"Germany's Securities Trading Act says that if BaFin finds such clues, it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor."
