In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m.

The move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina.

However, Mr Cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a Chinese internet portal firm, with its ability to filter and pass on news, may not be viewed very favourably by Beijing.

The board of directors said in a statement that it would "continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers".

Chinese online game operator Shanda Interactive Entertainment has bought a 20% stake in Sina, the country's biggest internet portal firm.
