Depending on how much they borrow or invest, members earn "reward" points which entitle them to a share of the society's profits.

Members of the UK's second largest building society will share £42m, with 100,000 receiving a windfall of more than £100.

To qualify for this year's payment, customers must have been members for at least two years on 31 December 2004.

Last year, Britannia members shared £42m, but the average payment was only £38.

The payouts are bigger than last year, because of stricter eligibility rules.
