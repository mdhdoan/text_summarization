"It appears that the UK is in a two-tier economy again," said Prebon Yamane economist Lena Komileva.

UK manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in January, according to a survey.

"You have weakness in manufacturing, which I think would concern policymakers at the Bank of England."

The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam.

The survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs.
