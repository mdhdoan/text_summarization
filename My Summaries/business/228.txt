Sri Lanka's banks face hard times following December's tsunami disaster, officials have warned.

In the public sector, more than one in ten of the state-owned People's Bank's customers in the south of Sri Lanka were affected, a bank spokesman told Reuters.

"Most banks have given moratoriums and will not be collecting interest, at least in this quarter," he said.
