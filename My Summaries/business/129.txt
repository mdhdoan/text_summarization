Bids have been invited from local, Arab and foreign companies, Iraq's Ministry of Communications said.

The ministry said it would base its selection on criteria including the speed of implementation, tariff rates, coverage, and the firm's experience and financial strength.

The firms will install and operate a fixed phone network, providing voice, fax and internet services.

The ministry said that it wanted to increase Iraq's "very low telephone service penetration rate from about 4.5% today to about 25% within 10 years."

Iraq is to invite bids for two telephone licences, saying it wants to significantly boost nationwide coverage over the next decade.
