Bids have been invited from local, Arab and foreign companies, Iraq's Ministry of Communications said.

The ministry said it would base its selection on criteria including the speed of implementation, tariff rates, coverage, and the firm's experience and financial strength.

The ministry said that it wanted to increase Iraq's "very low telephone service penetration rate from about 4.5% today to about 25% within 10 years."

Details of the bidding and tender process will be published on the ministry's website on 9 February.

Iraq is to invite bids for two telephone licences, saying it wants to significantly boost nationwide coverage over the next decade.
