Qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier Virgin Blue and the Australian government is in talks about whether to allow Singapore Airlines to fly between the Australia and the US - one of Qantas' key routes.

Net profit in the six months ending 31 December rose 28% to A$458.4m ($357.6m; Â£191m) from a year earlier.

Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain "all-Australian".

During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year.

Even so, the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months.
