Regent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: "The stores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last minute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the week."

Shops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before Christmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers.

That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales in the last couple of weeks.

"Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year," he said.

A spokesman for Manchester's Trafford Centre said it was "the biggest Christmas to date" with sales up 5%.
