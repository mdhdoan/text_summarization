Shops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before Christmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers.

"Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year," he said.

That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales in the last couple of weeks.

She said reports of a slump in pre-Christmas sales were related to the growing popularity of internet sales.

Regent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: "The stores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last minute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the week."
