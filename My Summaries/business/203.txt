Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May, Reuters says.

But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting.

However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: "TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25."

TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback.

Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid.
