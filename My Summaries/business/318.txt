A US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash.

Last week, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60% of its output.

Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part.

The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said.

The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
