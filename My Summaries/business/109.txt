Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.

In a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; Â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003.

The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share.

The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.

Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus.
