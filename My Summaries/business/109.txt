Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.

In a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; Â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003.

The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share.

It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business.

Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003.
