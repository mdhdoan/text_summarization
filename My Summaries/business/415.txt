The figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade.

Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005.

In London, the area with the highest average house price at Â£262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.

The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year.

The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September.
