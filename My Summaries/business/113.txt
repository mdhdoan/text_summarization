The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany.

The companies will have three months to respond to the Commission's allegations and the process "may go on for some time yet", the spokesman said.

The Commission's latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across Europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad.

In letters sent to the two companies, the Commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the German mobile phone market.

Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply.
