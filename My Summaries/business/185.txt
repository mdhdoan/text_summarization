The Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees.

"We, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost," Alexandra Tower, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank, told Time magazine.

Bank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre.

But although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss.
