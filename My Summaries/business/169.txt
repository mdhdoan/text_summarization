Jet's IPO is the first in a series of expected share offers from Indian companies this year, as they move to raise funds to help them do business in a rapidly-growing economy.

Investors have snapped up shares in Jet Airways, India's biggest airline, following the launch of its much anticipated initial public offer (IPO).

The share offer, representing about 20% of Jet's equity, was oversubscribed, news agency Reuters reported.

Interest in Jet's IPO has been fuelled by hopes for robust growth in India's air travel market.

The IPO for 17.3 million shares was fully sold within 10 minutes of opening, on Friday.
