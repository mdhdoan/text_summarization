Jet's IPO is the first in a series of expected share offers from Indian companies this year, as they move to raise funds to help them do business in a rapidly-growing economy.

Investors have snapped up shares in Jet Airways, India's biggest airline, following the launch of its much anticipated initial public offer (IPO).

Interest in Jet's IPO has been fuelled by hopes for robust growth in India's air travel market.

Analysts expect Jet to raise at least 16.4bn rupees ($375m; £198m) from the offering.

The IPO for 17.3 million shares was fully sold within 10 minutes of opening, on Friday.
