Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying.

"I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time."

But progress has been slow, reports from the country say.

Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women.

Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had "caused uproar" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices.
