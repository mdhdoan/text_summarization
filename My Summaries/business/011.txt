Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale.

Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.

Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week.

The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (Â£46m).

But on Thursday, it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits.
