Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale.

The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (Â£46m).

Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week.

Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.

In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%.
