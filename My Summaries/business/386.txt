Shares in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts have taken a dunking on Wall Street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports.

The firm is currently facing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of its accounts.

"There are many more questions than answers, especially given increased concerns regarding company liquidity," JP Morgan Securities analyst John Ivankoe said in a research note on the firm.

The revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors.

Shareholders have also launched lawsuits against the group, claiming it made false statements and inflated sales.
