AMR's shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated.

For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003's $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs.

American, the world's biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005.

American Airlines' parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (Â£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier.

Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.
