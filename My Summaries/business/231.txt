Venezuela has previously assured foreign companies with operations in the mineral rich country that it respects existing contracts.

President Hugo Chavez has ordered all existing contracts with foreign firms to be examined to see if they provide maximum benefits to the country.

Companies from the United States, Canada, France and Switzerland all have substantial investments in Venezuela's mining sector.

Chavez has sought to extend the state's role in all sectors of the economy.

However, the government insisted that it needed to develop its own industrial infrastructure in order to create new jobs and lessen its reliance on foreign partners.
