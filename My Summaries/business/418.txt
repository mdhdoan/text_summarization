"We are buying his name," Simon Falic told the Reuters news agency.

A US firm has said it is in final negotiations with luxury goods group LVMH to buy the loss-making Christian Lacroix haute-couture house.

The Florida company also own a chain of 90 duty free stores in the US.

But one of the three brothers behind the Falic Group said the firm had also held talks with the designer Christian Lacroix, and wished to retain him.

"We have plans to increase the exposure of the brand and increase the volume of business."
