Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless.

As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator.

Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas.

Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business.

The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however.
