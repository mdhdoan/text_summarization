Shares in Cairn Energy rose 3.8% to 1,088 pence on Tuesday after the UK firm announced a fresh gas discovery in northern India.

Cairn's string of finds in Rajasthan last year saw it elevated to the FTSE 100 index of the UK's leading listed companies.

The firm, which last year made a number of other new finds in the Rajasthan area, said the latest discovery could lead to large gas volumes.

A spokesman said the company's decision to carry out further investigations at the new find showed that it believed there was significant gas.

The company had bought the rights to explore in the area from oil giant Shell.
