Local press, meanwhile, have reported that the US and India will start negotiations about adding more routes in January.

However, only state controlled carriers will be able to fly the lucrative Gulf routes, to countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, for at least three years.

India will allow domestic commercial airlines to fly long haul international routes, a move it hopes will stoke competition and drive down prices.

Monica Chadha, BBC Delhi reporter, said air travel in India had increased by almost 20% from the previous year and was expected to rise even further.

Steps have been take to move things forward and the government recently changed legislation that limited foreign investment in domestic airlines.
