Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy.

Critics say the powers - which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights.

Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme.

The company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market.

Controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th Century.
