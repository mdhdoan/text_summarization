This compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in New York on Friday, which was then a record low.

Investors are betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not do anything to weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a declining dollar.

The US dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro.

The US is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar.

The US currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 GMT on Monday.
