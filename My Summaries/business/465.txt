Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud.

The trial of Bernie Ebbers, former chief executive of bankrupt US phone company WorldCom, has started in New York with the selection of the jury.

Under Mr Ebbers' leadership, WorldCom emerged from Mississippi obscurity to become a $160bn telecoms giant and the darling of late 1990s investors.

Trail preparations are also preparing for former executives of shamed US energy firm Enron.

When WorldCom finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs.
