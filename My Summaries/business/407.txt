India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel.

Filippo Bagnato, ATR's chief executive, has said that his firm will also work with Air Deccan to create a training centre in Bangalore.

Air Deccan has said it will base its business model on European firms such as Ireland's Ryanair.

Recently, India's first low-cost airline ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes for $1.8bn.

But Air Deccan's managing director Gorur Gopinath has said the price agreed was less than the catalogue price of $17.6m (Â£9.49m) per plane.
