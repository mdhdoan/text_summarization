In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a "preliminary approach", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer.

While United's board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer's latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.

At the club's annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board.

A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down.

"Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment.
