China is encouraging state-owned companies to sell shares to foreign investors.

Changyu said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange that Illva will pay 481.42m yuan ($58.16m; Â£30.7m), once the government approves the deal.

This compares with 59 litres in France, 12 litres in the US and three litres in Japan.

Italy's Illva Saronno has agreed to buy 33% of Changyu, the largest wine maker in China.

The Italian liqueur maker will acquire the shares from the Yantai State Asset Management Bureau.
