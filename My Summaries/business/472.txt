China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.

The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy.

The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad.

The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year.

That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists.
