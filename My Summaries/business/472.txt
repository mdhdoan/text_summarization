The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad.

China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.

Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.

The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy.

China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.
