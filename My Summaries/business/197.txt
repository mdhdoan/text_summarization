On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.

Thursday's ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale.

Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence.

The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold.

The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk, son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma, and Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest man.
