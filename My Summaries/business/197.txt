On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.

Thursday's ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale.

Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence.

The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold.

One of the foreign bidders who lost out, steel giant LNM, told BBC News that it would be interested in any renewed sale.
