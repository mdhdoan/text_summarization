A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises.

That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates.

"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York.

The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.

Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election.
