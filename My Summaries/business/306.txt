The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year.

UK retail sales were better than expected in November as Christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the High Street, figures show.

Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December.

However, retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November's unexpected rise in sales, they say.

However, recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% slip in High Street sales during November.
