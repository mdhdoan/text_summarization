A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company.

A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (Â£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.

However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April.

Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients.

A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.
