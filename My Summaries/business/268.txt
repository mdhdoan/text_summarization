One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares.

These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100.

One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust.

As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.

Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to Â£1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax.
