Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update.

Before Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.

December's share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month.

The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years.

The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries.
