The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit.The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast.Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing.In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000.
