The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing.The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit.The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast."It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year," said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.
