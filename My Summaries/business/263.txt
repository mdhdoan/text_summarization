Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year.

Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA).

Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.

"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome," Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News.

Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive Â£194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.
