While domestic demand is set to continue to enjoy rapid growth, foreign sales could come under pressure, analysts said.

Strong economic growth and low interest rates have driven demand, and analysts expect the trend to continue.

However, the world auto market has its problems and analysts warn that overcapacity and the strength of the rand could hit exports.

Car manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004.

New vehicle sales jumped 22% to 449,603 from a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said.
