Strong economic growth and low interest rates have driven demand, and analysts expect the trend to continue.

While domestic demand is set to continue to enjoy rapid growth, foreign sales could come under pressure, analysts said.

New vehicle sales jumped 22% to 449,603 from a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said.

Car manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004.

The vehicle industry accounts for about 13% of South Africa's total exports.
