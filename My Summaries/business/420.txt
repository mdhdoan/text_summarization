The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.

Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China.

ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement.

The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos.

India has signed a $40bn (Â£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.
