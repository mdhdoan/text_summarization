Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.

The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan's massive public debt.

The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around.

The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery.

But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.
