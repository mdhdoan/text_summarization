However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted.

UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.

"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services."

"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures," said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward.

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year.
