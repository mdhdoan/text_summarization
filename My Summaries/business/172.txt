Consumer demand will remain fragile in many of Europe's largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports.

The European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005, according to a new report.

Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented "huge risks" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year.

Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies.

The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.
