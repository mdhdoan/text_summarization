The decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the Bank of England's rate-setting body, minutes have shown.

The Bank's minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were "sufficiently to the downside" to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting.

However, the minutes added: "Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection".

One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%.

The Bank's latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.
