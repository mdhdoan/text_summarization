According to Standard & Poor's, which has recently upgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating, the rise in remittances helps protect the Mexican economy against a potential fall in the international oil prices.

The Bank of Mexico said that remittances grew 24% last year and now represent the country's second-biggest source of income after oil.

Remittances now represent more than 2% of the country's GDP, according to the Bank of Mexico's figures.

The growth in remittances has sparked fierce competition between banks.

Mexican labourers living in the US sent a record $16.6bn (Â£8.82bn) home last year.
