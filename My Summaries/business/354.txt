Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.

In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost.

But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.

Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as Aceh in Indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia's listed companies, according to analysts.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia.
