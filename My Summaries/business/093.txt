Sorting out its debt would enhance the country's credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment.

Investors in the UK, Holland and Luxembourg have about 1% each and the remainder were not broken down by country.

The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years.

The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer.
