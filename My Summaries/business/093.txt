The deal is likely to be taken up most enthusiastically by domestic investors, who will benefit if Argentina's economy becomes more stable.

Sorting out its debt would enhance the country's credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment.

The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer.

The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years.

If the offer does not go ahead, international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through, despite the tough terms for bondholders.
