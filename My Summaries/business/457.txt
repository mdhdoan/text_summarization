German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.

A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules.

The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members.

Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact.

These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering "special economic burdens".
