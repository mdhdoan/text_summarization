The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP.

These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering "special economic burdens".

German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.

The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members.

The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.
