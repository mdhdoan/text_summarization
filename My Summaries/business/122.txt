US bank in $515m SEC settlement

The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlements, the latest in an industry-wide clean-up of US mutual funds.

These businesses became part of BOA when it snapped up rival bank FleetBoston in a $47bn merger last March.

Five Bank of America subsidiaries have agreed to pay a total of $515m (Â£277m) to settle an investigation into fraudulent trading share practices.

Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives.
