India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand.

Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004.

Demand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.

Net profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; Â£29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier.

Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units.
