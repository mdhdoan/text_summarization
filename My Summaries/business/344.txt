Thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.

Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies.

The dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy.

Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month.

The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits.
