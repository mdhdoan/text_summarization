Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country's public finances.

Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed.

In certain cases, staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings.

The prime minister's office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry.

Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments.
