Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country's public finances.

Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed.

The government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries.

Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments.

Cameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn CFA francs ($2m; Â£1m) a month.
