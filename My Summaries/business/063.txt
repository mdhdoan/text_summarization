Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January's figures were "decent numbers".

Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting.

Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004.

US retail sales fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly decline since last August, driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.
