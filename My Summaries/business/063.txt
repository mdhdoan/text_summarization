Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004.

The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers.

Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting.

Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January's figures were "decent numbers".
