The bank - along with investors, auditors and the group's managers - wants damages for being a victim of fraud at the hands of the Italian firm.

Parmalat collapsed in December 2003 after it emerged that the 4bn euros ($5.2bn; Â£2.8bn) it supposedly held in a Bank of American offshore account did not in fact exist.

But a judge has barred Bank of America and two auditors from the case.

Grant Thornton - now rid of the Italian unit at the centre of the case - is still being permitted to sue, as are Consob, Italy's stock market regulator, hundreds of small investors and Parmalat's new managers.

Bank of America has been banned from suing Parmalat, the food group which went bust in 2003 after an accounting scandal.
