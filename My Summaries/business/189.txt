Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.

Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales.

Sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market.

Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years.

"I have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company's recovery," he said.
