Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales.

Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years.

Sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market.

Last year, he said that a series of new models, launched as part of the group's recovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped.

"I have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company's recovery," he said.
