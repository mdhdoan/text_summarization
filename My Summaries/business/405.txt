The survey seems to fly in the face of recent evidence that the UK housing market has been slowing substantially in response to interest rate rises.

Experts believe five interest rate rises since November 2003 are cutting borrowers' appetite for debt.

The bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of England continued in December.

UK house prices increased by 1.1% in December, the first monthly rise since September, the Halifax has said.

Capital Economics, which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in UK house prices, branded Halifax's findings a "temporary surprise," which would be reversed over the coming months.
