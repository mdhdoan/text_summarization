On Tuesday, figures from the Bank of England showed that the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade.

New loans in November fell to 77,000, from 85,000 in October, the lowest rate since September 1995, the Bank of England said.

Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said that there was no need to revise the bank's prediction, made last month, that prices would fall by 2% in 2005.

Capital Economics, which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in UK house prices, branded Halifax's findings a "temporary surprise," which would be reversed over the coming months.

UK house prices increased by 1.1% in December, the first monthly rise since September, the Halifax has said.
