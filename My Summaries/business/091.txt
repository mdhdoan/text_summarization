Russia's reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant Yukos.

The company's founder and ex-chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud.

The Yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which Ms Hessel alludes.

Instead, with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, S&P said the government's own debt is looking a good bet.

Soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean Russian debt is no longer a risky investment, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies says.
