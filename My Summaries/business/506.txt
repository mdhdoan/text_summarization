Mr Botin is accused of misusing the bank's funds after he approved the payment of 160m euros ($208m; £111m) in bonus and pension payouts to two former executives.

In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the £8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National.

The trial of Emilio Botin, the chairman of Spain's most powerful bank, Santander Central Hispano, has started in Madrid.

Since taking over the chairmanship in 1986, he has turned Santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world.

Santander's board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support.
