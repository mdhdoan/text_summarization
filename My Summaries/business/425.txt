Nortel's head Frank Dunn and two other executives were fired in January last year after the company announced it had conducted the internal audit.

The company also said 12 senior executives - none of whom were involved directly in the accounting of the revised figures - have voluntarily agreed to repay to bonuses awarded in 2003 totalling $8.6m.

Nortel shares, which have lost nearly 50% of their value since last year, climbed 1.46% in Toronto on Tuesday.

But the figures - revised after an audit which led to the sacking of the Canadian firm's chief - showed revenue was about 4% higher than first thought.

Securities and police authorities in both the US and Canada are still conducting inquiries into the accounts.
