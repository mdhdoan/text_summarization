The French economy picked up speed at the end of 2004, official figures show - but still looks set to have fallen short of the government's hopes.

Despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth, the good quarterly figures - a so-called "flash estimate" - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the French economy.

According to state statistics body INSEE, growth for the three months to December was a seasonally-adjusted 0.7-0.8%, ahead of the 0.6% forecast.

It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted.

Also on Friday, France's industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth.
