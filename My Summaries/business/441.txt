November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months.

The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union.

Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.

EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals.
