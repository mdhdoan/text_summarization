The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union.

The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports.

November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.

Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months.
