Nevertheless, the Egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria.

Both the IMF and World Bank have urged Egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy.

The Egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country's big public banks.

Analysts say the public-sector banks have suited the government's monetary, credit and exchange policies.

The official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation.
