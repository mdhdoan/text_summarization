UK mortgage lending showed a "post-Christmas lull" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said.

"These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market," Peter Williams, CML deputy director, said.

Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by £4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the £5.1bn seen in December.

The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at £17.9bn, compared with £21.8bn in January last year.

This was a return to the "weaker pattern" of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added.
