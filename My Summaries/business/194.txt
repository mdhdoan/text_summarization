UK mortgage lending showed a "post-Christmas lull" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said.

Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by £4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the £5.1bn seen in December.

"These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market," Peter Williams, CML deputy director, said.

The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at £17.9bn, compared with £21.8bn in January last year.

At the same time, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said lending was "weaker".
