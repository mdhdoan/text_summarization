Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.

TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.

The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales.

TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators.

However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues.
