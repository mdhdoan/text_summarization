Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.

The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales.

TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators.

TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.

It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.
