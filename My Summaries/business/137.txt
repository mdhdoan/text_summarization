UK interest rates are set to remain on hold at 4.75% following the latest meeting of the Bank of England.

"I still think interest rates are going up," he said.

Last month, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said that the economy had hit a "softer patch" after rapid economic growth in the first half of 2004.

There is also growing evidence that the previously booming UK housing market is now cooling.

"There have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the Bank of England's hand," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
