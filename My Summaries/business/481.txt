Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates.

Retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

The ONS echoed an earlier caution from Bank of England governor Mervyn King not to read too much into the poor December figures.

UK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981.

"The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter," said Mr Shaw.
