Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston's DB9, which Mr Bez described as "the previous most important car for our company".

Mr Bez - himself a former executive at rival Porsche - said the new car was the company's "most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible".

The Vantage is "the most important car in the history of our company", said Aston's chief executive Ulrich Bez.

There is currently an 18 months waiting list for the DB9, Mr Bez said.

First shown as a concept car at the 2003 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the V8 Vantage will be available in the UK in late summer.
