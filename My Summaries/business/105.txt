Mr Bez - himself a former executive at rival Porsche - said the new car was the company's "most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible".

The Vantage is "the most important car in the history of our company", said Aston's chief executive Ulrich Bez.

Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston's DB9, which Mr Bez described as "the previous most important car for our company".

British car maker Aston Martin has gone head-to-head with Porsche's 911 sports cars with the launch of its cheapest model yet.

There is currently an 18 months waiting list for the DB9, Mr Bez said.
