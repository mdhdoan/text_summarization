A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits.

Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK.

Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005.

This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS.

Approximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK.
