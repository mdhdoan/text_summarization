The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations.

One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.

This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.

Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear.

The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world.
