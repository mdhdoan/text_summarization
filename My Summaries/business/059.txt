Prosecution lawyers have argued that Mr Ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at WorldCom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet Wall Street earnings estimates.

The prosecution's star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to "hit our books".

Ms Cooper also said that during shareholder meetings Mr Ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only "brief" answers himself.

Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.

Mr Ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.
