German airline Lufthansa may sue federal agencies for damages after the arrival of US president George W Bush disrupted flights.

Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany's air traffic controllers' organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders.

Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport.

Central to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said.

Flights were affected for an hour on Wednesday morning, double the time that had been expected, leading to cancellations and delays.
