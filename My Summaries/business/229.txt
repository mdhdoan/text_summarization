The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with "detailed proposals", it has confirmed.

Shares in Manchester United closed up 4.75% on Monday following a new offer from US tycoon Malcolm Glazer.

A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share.

His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.

David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a "well funded" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.
