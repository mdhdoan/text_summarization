Inbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; Â£800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005.

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros.

The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase.

Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported.

The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004.
