The bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; £27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property.

Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.

The island state is asking for about $320m from the International Monetary Fund to help pay for relief, he said.

A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come.

Sri Lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors.
