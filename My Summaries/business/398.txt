The currency has strengthened 4% since late December, coming close to 100 rupees to the US dollar for the first time in more than six months.

Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.

The Paris Club of 19 creditors meets on 12 January to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami, which ravaged south and east Asia on 26 December.

The bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; £27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property.

One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country.
