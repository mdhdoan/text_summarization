"The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country," he said.

Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy.

Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives.

All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's "convertible" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax.

"It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue."
