The Japanese government has forecast that the country's economic growth will slow to 1.6% in the next fiscal year starting in April 2005.

To ease the problem the Bank of Japan has regularly flooded the money market with excess cash to keep short term interest rates at 0% in an attempt to spur economic activity.

The figures were given by economics minister Heizo Takenaka who said the economy would grow by 2% in 2006/07.

Deflation - or falling consumer prices - has plagued Japan for more than five years.

He said the consumer price index (CPI) would rise 0.1% in the next fiscal year, the first gain since 2000/01.
