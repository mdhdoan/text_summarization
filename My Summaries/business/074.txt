Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal.

Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.

The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.

In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel.

If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running.
