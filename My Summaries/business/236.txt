Retail Decisions' survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system, but that banks' performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy, at best.

"We have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the UK... since the start of the year.

UK shoppers spent £5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available from the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs).

Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments.

Within this, internet fraud totalled £43m, Apacs' figures show.
