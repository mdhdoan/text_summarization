Anil Ambani, the younger of the two brothers in charge of India's largest private company, has resigned from running its petrochemicals subsidiary.

The brothers' spat has hogged headlines in India during recent weeks, despite a denial from the family that there was anything wrong.

Reliance's operations have massive reach, covering textiles, telecommunications, petrochemicals, petroleum refining and marketing, as well as oil and gas exploration, insurance and financial services.

Shares of IPC dipped on the news in Mumbai, but recovered to trade almost 6% higher.

Reliance shares added 1.7%, while Reliance Energy, headed by Anil, jumped 7%.
