Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m).

"Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining that the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in their hands, paid out in dividends," Mr Faraj continued.

Sales climbed to 364.4m euros, lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros.

Analysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to its bid for the London Stock Exchange.

Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered £1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn euros) for the London Stock Exchange.
