The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year.

However, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies.

The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters.

Ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter.

Japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005.
