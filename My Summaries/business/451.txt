The two companies held four days of talks after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January.

"Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company," said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn.

Shares in both companies were suspended while the two held talks about a deal.

Southcorp's shares rose 12% to A$4.76 on news of the offer but Foster's shares fell 3.7% to A$5.44.

A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of A$2.6bn.
