The moves come as the firms face criticism from consumer groups concerned at rising levels of obesity in US children.

But the firm said it would continue to advertise all its products in media seen by parents and "all family" audiences.

Kraft plans to cut back on advertising of products like Oreo cookies and sugary Kool-Aid drinks as part of an effort to promote healthy eating.

"We're working on ways to encourage both adults and children to eat wisely by selecting more nutritionally balanced diets," said Lance Friedmann, Kraft senior vice president.

Kraft rival PepsiCo began a similar labelling initiative last year.
