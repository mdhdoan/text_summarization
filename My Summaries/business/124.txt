The firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year.

The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; Â£38.4m).

The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.

Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the country's third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm.

But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006.
