The economy is set for strong growth in 2005 while interest rates remain low.

The ISEQ index of leading shares closed up 23 points to 6661.89 on Thursday, fuelled by strong growth in banking and financial stocks.

Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's biggest company by capitalisation, touched a five year peak while Bank of Ireland shares rose to their highest level since August 2002.

A fall in the rate of inflation to 2.3% in January gave a fresh boost to shares which have advanced 4% this month.

The economy cooled markedly between 2001 and 2003 after enjoying spectacular growth of more than 10% in 2000.
