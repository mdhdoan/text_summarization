Singapore's economy had contracted over the summer, weighed down by soaring oil prices.

The economy's poor performance in the July to September period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as Singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly Sars virus in 2003.

Slowdowns in the US and China could hit electronics exports, while the tsunami disaster may effect the service sector.

However, a slower-than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade-driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back.

The advance, the second-fastest in Asia after China, was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector.
