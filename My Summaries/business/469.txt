Turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the International Monetary Fund to borrow $10bn (Â£5.19bn), extending its ongoing financial support until 2007.

"I believe the new programme, if implemented successfully, will help Turkey create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation, reduce inflation toward European level and enhance the economy's resilience," he said.

Economic growth has average 6-7% in the past three years, ahead of IMF forecasts, while inflation fell below 10% this year for the first time in 30 years.

Such reforms are considered vital for Turkey if it is to fulfil its ambition of joining the European Union.

The US, the largest of the IMF's 184 members, is a strong supporter of continued financial support for Turkey.
