Parmalat is now being run by a state appointed administrator, Enrico Bondi, who has launched lawsuits against 80 banks in an effort to recover money for the bankrupt company and its shareholders.

Parmalat was placed into bankruptcy protection in 2003 after a 14bn euro black hole was found in its accounts.

More than 130,000 people lost money following the firm's collapse.

Two former Parmalat auditors will stand trial later this month for their role in the firm's collapse.

He has alleged that these companies were aware of the true state of Parmalat's finances but continued to lend money to the company.
