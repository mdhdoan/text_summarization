Parmalat is now being run by a state appointed administrator, Enrico Bondi, who has launched lawsuits against 80 banks in an effort to recover money for the bankrupt company and its shareholders.

Prosecutors are seeking indictments against Mr Tanzi and 28 others - including several members of his family and former Parmalat chief financial officer Fausto Tonna - for alleged manipulation of stock market prices and making misleading statements to accountants and Italy's financial watchdog.

Two former Parmalat auditors will stand trial later this month for their role in the firm's collapse.

The founder and former boss of Parmalat has apologised to investors who lost money as a result of the Italian dairy firm's collapse.

More than 130,000 people lost money following the firm's collapse.
