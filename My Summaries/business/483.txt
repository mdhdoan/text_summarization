The sale is the last part of a plan to restructure 2.4bn euros-worth of debts.

EuroDisney, the European home of Mickey Mouse and friends, has said it will sell 253m euros (Â£175m; $328m) of new shares as it looks to avoid insolvency.

The US Disney Corporation and Saudi Arabian prince Al-Walid bin Talal, the firm's two main shareholders, will buy the new stock.

The company's currently traded stock tumbled in Paris on the latest news, shedding 15% to 22 euro cents.

The restructuring deal is the second in the firm's troubled financial history; its finances were first reorganised in 1994.
