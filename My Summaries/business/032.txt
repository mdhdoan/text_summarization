Sumitomo, Japan's third-largest bank, tabled a higher offer for UFJ than its rival, valuing the company at $35bn.

The deal would create the world's biggest bank with assets of about 189 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion).

UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth-largest bank, has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year.

However, UFJ's management was known to prefer the offer from Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG), Japan's second-largest bank.

Japanese banks are increasingly seeking alliances to boost profits.
