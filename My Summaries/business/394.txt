The seventh largest carrier in the US sought bankruptcy protection for a second time in two years last September.

The deal will help the carrier, trying to survive by cutting costs by nearly $1bn (Â£530m) a year, save about $94m.

US Airways management has said it may need to start liquidating assets if it does not receive concessions from all staff by the middle of this month.

A union representing 5,200 flight attendants at bankrupt US Airways have agreed to a new contract that cuts pay by nearly 10%.

But it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2003 to face competition from low-cost carriers and higher fuel costs.
