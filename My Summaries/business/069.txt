Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract.

Net profit was $186m (Â£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.

The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane.

These orders should help underpin the company's profits.

Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders.
