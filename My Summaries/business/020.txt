There are "no big differences in wait time and call resolution" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world.

As a result, call centres have a high "churn rate", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff.

Suggestions that "outsourcing" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.

The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.

Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money.
