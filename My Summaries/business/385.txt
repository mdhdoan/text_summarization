Iain Ferguson was awarded the title by US publication Forbes for returning one of the UK's "venerable" manufacturers to the country's top 100 companies.

Tate's shares have leapt 55% this year, boosted by firming sugar prices and sales of its artificial sweeteners.

Tate & Lyle, which was an original member of the historic FT-30 index in 1935, operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production facilities in 28 countries.

The sugar group had been absent from the FTSE 100 for seven years until Mr Ferguson helped it return to growth.

"After years of a sagging stock price and a seven-year hiatus from the FTSE 100, one of Britain's venerable manufacturers has returned to the vaunted index," Forbes said.
