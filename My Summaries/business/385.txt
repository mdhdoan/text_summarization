Iain Ferguson was awarded the title by US publication Forbes for returning one of the UK's "venerable" manufacturers to the country's top 100 companies.

Tate's shares have leapt 55% this year, boosted by firming sugar prices and sales of its artificial sweeteners.

The sugar group had been absent from the FTSE 100 for seven years until Mr Ferguson helped it return to growth.

Tate & Lyle, which was an original member of the historic FT-30 index in 1935, operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production facilities in 28 countries.

Tate & Lyle's chief executive has been named European Businessman of the Year by a leading business magazine.
