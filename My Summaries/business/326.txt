Fannie Mae was found to have violated accounting rules relating to derivatives - financial instruments used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates - and some pre-paid loans.

The two most senior executives at US mortgage giant Fannie Mae have resigned after accounting irregularities were uncovered at the company.

Although not making loans directly to buyers, Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all US house purchases.

The problems afflicting Fannie Mae are just the latest to hit the US mortgage industry.

Analysts said the SEC's criticism made it impossible for Fannie Mae's senior executives to remain.
