In a separate statement, the EU said that the US should back Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation.

Ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links.

Mr Yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on Russia, which borders the country to the east, saying it was important to maintain 'pragmatic' ties with Moscow.

He cited last year's sale of Ukrainian steel producer Krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns.

He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership, the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements.
