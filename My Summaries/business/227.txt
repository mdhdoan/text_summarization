The TUC said in its submission before the Budget that action is needed because of 105,000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year.

The 36-page submission also urges the government to examine support other European countries provide to industry.

The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling on the government to stem job losses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies.

"A commitment to our public services and manufacturing sector ensures that we can continue to compete on a global level and deliver the frontline services that this country needs."

TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber called for "a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to the lives of working people."
