The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with "detailed proposals", it has confirmed.

Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back, with a statement issued on Sunday reading: "The board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer.

Meanwhile, United's chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with "definitive proposals".

Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid.

But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid.
