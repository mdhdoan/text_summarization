Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid.

Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted.

Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last November.

Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at Â£800m.

The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with "detailed proposals", it has confirmed.
