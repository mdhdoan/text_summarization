Shares tumbled, however, as the company reported a profit margin of 45.6%, less than the 47.3% forecast by analysts and down from 47.1% in the third quarter.

However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor.

Mr Svanberg, however, warned that the extra demand that had driven 2004 sales had already dissipated and it was "business as usual".

Operating profit in the three months to 31 December was 9.5bn kronor (Â£722m; $1.3bn) against 6.3bn kronor last year.

He added that sales in the first three months of 2005 would be subject to "normal seasonality".
