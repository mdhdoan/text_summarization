But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale.

The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices.

A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.

The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (Â£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups.

But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms.
