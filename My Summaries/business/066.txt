Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas.

Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank.

German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy.

Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish.

Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003.
