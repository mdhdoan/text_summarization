Shanghai Automotive's proposed Â£1bn investment in Rover is awaiting approval by its owner, the Shanghai city government and by the National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees foreign investment by Chinese firms.

According to the FT, the regulator has been annoyed by Rover's decision to talk publicly about the deal and the intense speculation which has ensued about what it will mean for Rover's future.

MG Rover's proposed tie-up with China's top carmaker has been delayed due to concerns by Chinese regulators, according to the Financial Times.

There has been continued speculation about the viability of Rover's Longbridge plant because of falling sales and unfashionable models.

The paper said that Chinese officials believe cutbacks will be required to keep the MG Rover's costs in line with revenues.
