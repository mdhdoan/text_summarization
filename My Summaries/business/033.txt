Half of the money put aside by the Colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found.

Government expenditure in areas such as pensions, public services, education, property and health should be revised, Mr Leibovich said.

He added that the government is now examining the report, but warned there would be no easy solution to the problem.

With a good distribution of such subsidies and economic growth of just 2%, by 2019 poverty could fall as low as 15.3%, he said.

Sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes.
