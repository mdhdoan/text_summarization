Halifax's own monthly figures on house sales - issued on Thursday - suggest the average price of a British property now stands at £163,748 after a 0.8% rise in January.

But Northern Ireland led the way with a 262% rise, while Scotland saw the smallest increase of just 112%.

The value of the UK's housing stock reached the £3.3 trillion mark in 2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates.

More than a third of the UK's private housing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are concentrated in London and the South East, the Halifax's figures indicate.

Research from Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, suggests the value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily.
