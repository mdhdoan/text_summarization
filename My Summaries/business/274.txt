In its first earnings report since floating on the stock market, Google said it made a net profit of $52m in the three months ending 30 September.

However, analysts say they expected most shareholders would be holding back from selling all their shares immediately, as Google's good performance and future growth potential means demand will hold.

In one of the most closely-watched initial public offerings in stock market history, the US-based company sold 19.6 million shares at $85 each.

Sales surged to $805.9m in the third quarter, up from $393.9m a year earlier.

There were fears that the potential increase of shares in circulation from Tuesday would ease demand for stock.
