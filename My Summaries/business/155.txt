The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn.

Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.

Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January.

The deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US.

The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed.
