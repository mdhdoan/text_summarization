Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January.

Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.

The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn.

As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn.

The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed.
