"GM reported solid overall results in 2004, despite challenging competitive conditions in many markets around the globe," GM chairman and chief executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement.

The results were in line with Wall Street expectations and shares in GM rose by about 1% in pre-market trade.

General Motors (GM) saw its net profits fall 37% in the last quarter of 2004, as it continued to be hit by losses at its European operations.

GM said its profits were also hit by higher healthcare costs in the US.

Excluding special items, GM's global income from continuing operations totalled $569m during the quarter, down from $838m a year earlier.
