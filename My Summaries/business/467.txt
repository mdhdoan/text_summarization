The US giant earned $630m (Â£481.5m) in the October-to-December period, down from $1bn in the fourth quarter of 2003.

"GM reported solid overall results in 2004, despite challenging competitive conditions in many markets around the globe," GM chairman and chief executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement.

General Motors (GM) saw its net profits fall 37% in the last quarter of 2004, as it continued to be hit by losses at its European operations.
