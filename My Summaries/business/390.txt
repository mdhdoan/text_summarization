The alleged violations included the sale of guns to 23 people who were not allowed to possess them, and delivering 36 guns to customers who acquired them for people not allowed to own firearms.

"Although Wal-Mart has suspended gun sales in California, this settlement will ensure that it follows state law if it renews sales and will also provide valuable public education about the importance of gun safety."

The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, has agreed to pay a total of $14.5m (Â£7.74m) to settle a lawsuit over gun sales violations in California.

The world's largest retailer has not yet decided whether to resume firearms sales in California, company spokesman Gus Whitcomb said.

Although Wal-Mart has suspended firearms sales in the state, California attorney general Bill Lockyer said he wanted to be sure the giant supermarket chain would follow state rules in future.
