Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.

The Indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms.

However, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India's own "self reliance".

Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too.

India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.
