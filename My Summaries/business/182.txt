"[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment," said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires.

World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.

At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth.

Analysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff.

The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment.
