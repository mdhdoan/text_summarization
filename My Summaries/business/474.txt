"Sluggish demand reported previously for November and now December 2004 continues," said Virgin Blue chief executive Brett Godfrey.

Virgin Blue said profits after tax for the year to March would be between 10% to 15% lower than the previous year.

In November, first half profits were down due to slack demand and rising fuel costs.

Shares in its major shareholder, Patrick Corporation - which owns 46% of Virgin Blue - had dropped 31% by the close.

Shares in Australian budget airline Virgin Blue plunged 20% after it warned of a steep fall in full year profits.
