The government has announced that firms will be barred from 2006 from imposing arbitrary retirement ages.

The decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said.

"This makes a mockery of the Government's so-called commitment to outlawing ageism, leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel," said Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England .

"It is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using European law."

Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age.
