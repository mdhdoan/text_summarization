BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.

Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier.

Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive.

Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were "respectable" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%.

BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.
