The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation.

The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.

"I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions," Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, told the Associated Press news agency.

France fell behind the 'New World' producers of Australia, Chile and the United States for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports.

In an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement.
