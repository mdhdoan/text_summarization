The move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks.

"It is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years."

A row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant Orange launched action against a new mobile venture from Easyjet's founder.

However, Mr Haji-Ioannou, who plans to launch Easymobile next month, vowed to fight back, saying: "We have nothing to be afraid of in this court case.

"Our brand, and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us," Orange said in a statement.
