The figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy since the 1930s.

And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million.

The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate.

Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month.

Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January.
