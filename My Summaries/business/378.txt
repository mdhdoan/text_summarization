Analysts say thay may not happen as Russia, the world's leading gas producer, needs the cheap Turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned Gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in Siberia.

The deal was sealed three days after Turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the Ukrainian economy.

Mr Niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to Russia.

The head of the Ukrainian state-owned Naftohaz company, Yury Boyko, said he was "fully happy" with the deal.

Turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with Russia, which is not so dependent on its gas.
