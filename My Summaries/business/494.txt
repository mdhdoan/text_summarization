Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (Â£558m) stock market debut last month.

There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year.

But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.

European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.

It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.
