Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.

The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.

Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November.

Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.

The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year.
