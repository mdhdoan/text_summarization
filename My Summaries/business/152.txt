Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.

Crude oil prices back above $50

A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday.

The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.

The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year.
