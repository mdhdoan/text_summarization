The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.

About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit.

Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation's poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m.

At the heart of the administration's fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures.

Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq.
