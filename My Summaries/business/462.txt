GM, whose brands include Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet in the US and Opel, Saab and Vauxhall in Europe, is due to reveal 2004 earnings on 19 January.

The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, and weak US sales.

"Attaining earnings of $10 a share remains GM's goal," the company said, adding it believes it can achieve this in 2007.

GMAC has been a strong contributor to profits in 2004 but GM said it will do less well this year, delivering net income of $2.5bn.

GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.
