It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection.

Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill.

Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday.

The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos.

The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia.
