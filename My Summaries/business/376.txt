Investors are concerned about the size of the US trade and budget deficits and are betting that George W Bush's administration will allow the dollar to weaken despite saying they favour a strong currency.

The US dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in 2005.

Also playing on investors' minds are mixed reports about the state of the US economy.

Earlier on Thursday, the Japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in Asia.

"People want to go into the weekend and the New Year positioned for a weaker buck," said Tim Mazanec, director of foreign exchange at Investors Bank and Trust.
