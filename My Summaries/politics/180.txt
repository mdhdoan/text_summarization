Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill.

He told BBC News: "We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.

Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia "through the back door" were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said.

But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an "excellent job".

Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords.
