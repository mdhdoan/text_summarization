With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity.

In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election.

Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: "There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe."

Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.

On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: "Of course I trust the prime minister."
