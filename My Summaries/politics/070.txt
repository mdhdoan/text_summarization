Home Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect.

But Mr Howard said: "We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life."

The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.
