A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.

Tony Blair has argued.

Mr Clarke said the issue "went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system".

But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a "large majority".

And they list former Conservative leader William Hague and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock as supporters of the plans.
