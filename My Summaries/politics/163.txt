The former Labour leader said he would probably take the title of Lord Kinnock of Bedwellty - his first constituency for which he was selected in 1969.

"It was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the Lords and people there willing to vote for it."

Mr Kinnock said he thought about the decision for "quite a long time" because he had long had reservations about the Lords.

But the outgoing European Commissioner said his comments - made some 26 years ago - needed to be put in context.

"History demonstrates that it's immensely useful for the British Council to have its chairman in the House of Lords and that was a conclusive factor."
