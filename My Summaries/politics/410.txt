Conservative leader Michael Howard has now accepted the MP's resignation, it has been announced.

After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election.

Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was "unjust and wrong" but he made an "unreserved" apology to MPs in the Commons chamber.

Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen "well below the standards expected".

The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament.
