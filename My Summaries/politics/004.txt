"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country."

The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.

The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.

For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton.

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event.
