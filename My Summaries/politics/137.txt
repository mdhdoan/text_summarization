Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.

Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed.

Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts.

They were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters.

"However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain."
