"However, in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the Party, he has decided not to stand in the Sedgefield constituency at the next election."

"He fully supports the party's policies on, and approach to, the public services," said the statement.

Labour election coordinator Alan Milburn claimed Mr Kruger had exposed the Tory agenda for Â£35bn of cuts to public services.

Tory leader Michael Howard accepted his decision "with regret".

He says his remark last week was misrepresented but he will not contest the election for fear of damaging the Conservative cause.
