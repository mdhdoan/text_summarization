Britain's young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups.

Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents.

The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work.

The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called 'Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society'.

He added: "But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing.
