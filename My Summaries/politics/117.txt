Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind.

The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto.

"I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords.

The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker.

Lady Boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of Speaker.
