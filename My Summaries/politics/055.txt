Head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour.

Ms Kelly told the BBC progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems.

She categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister.

"I would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision."

Ms Kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight.
