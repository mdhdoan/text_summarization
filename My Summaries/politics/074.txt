The leader of the British National Party has been arrested as part of a police inquiry following the screening of a BBC documentary.

West Yorkshire police confirmed they had arrested a 45-year-old man from outside their area.

In July, the BBC documentary Secret Agent featured covertly-filmed footage of BNP activists.

BNP founding chairman John Tyndall was arrested on Sunday on the same charge.

Two men, both from Keighley, were arrested in September on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage.
