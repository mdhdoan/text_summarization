The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".

Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.

A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row.

Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: "It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches."

The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.
