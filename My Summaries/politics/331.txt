Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: "It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches."

The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".

The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: "I can spend the same money twice."

Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday.

It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.
