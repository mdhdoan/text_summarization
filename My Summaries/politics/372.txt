Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges "on a scale not seen since the 19th Century".

A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout.

But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.

Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA).

Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll.
