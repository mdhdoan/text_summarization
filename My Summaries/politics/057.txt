"I will be drawing on my experience of working with children and young people to help ensure that those with the power to improve children's lives do live up to their responsibilities.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already have children's commissioners.

"I want all children and young people to know that they can approach me to discuss any matter that affects them, knowing that I will value their opinion."

Education Secretary Ruth Kelly said Prof Aynsley-Green would "strengthen the voice of children and young people".

He will oversee a Â£2.5m annual budget and have the power to look into "any matter relating to the interests and well-being of children".
