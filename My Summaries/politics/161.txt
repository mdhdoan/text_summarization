The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were "wrong", Mr Blair said.

Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea.

Turkey's involvement with the EU would provide an "invaluable bridge" between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added.

A deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership is of "fundamental importance" to the peace and security of the world, Tony Blair has said.

Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was "anti-Islamic".
