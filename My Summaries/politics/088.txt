He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls.

Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: "The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."

A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.

A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.

Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
