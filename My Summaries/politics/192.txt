All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.

All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.

Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after "intensive and complex discussions" over security.

Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars.

Civil rights group Liberty said it was "delighted" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.
