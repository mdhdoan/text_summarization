But as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper, the party at least has reason to hope that, like his Australian namesake, Mr Howard really isn't finished yet.

But Mr Howard's overall message - that the Tories have Labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago.

The speech, which was peppered with references to Mr Howard's humble beginnings as the "child of immigrants", had been introduced by his son Nick, a trainee vicar, who praised his father's honesty.

Mr Howard claimed, with some justification, that the Tories' campaign has got off to a "great start".

Mr Howard was also joined on stage by his wife Sandra, daughter Larissa and stepson Sholto.
