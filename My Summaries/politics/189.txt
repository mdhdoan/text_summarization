Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an "umbilical cord" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.

Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his "warmest congratulations", saying: "We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom."

Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election "a true celebration of American democracy".

Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most "pressing political challenge" of the present day, Mr Blair warned.

Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.
