Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an "umbilical cord" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.

Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election "a true celebration of American democracy".

Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was "fractured, divided and uncertain", Mr Blair said.

Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.

Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most "pressing political challenge" of the present day, Mr Blair warned.
