He accused Mr Blair's government of "being less than straightforward" over its plans.

Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.

"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq," Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech.

In a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a "crucible of militant terrorism".

Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - "especially Islamic countries".
