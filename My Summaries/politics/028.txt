The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged.

Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying.

But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.

A judge should look into the David Blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the Lib Dems say.

But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems.
