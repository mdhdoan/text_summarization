Mr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the "ticking bomb" of council tax revaluation, saying it was "high time" the system was replaced by a "local tax based on the ability to pay".

"This government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems Britain faces," Mr Howard told MPs.

Tory leader Michael Howard predicted the Budget would do nothing to help Labour's "faltering" election campaign.

Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.

Mr Brown told MPs child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children.
