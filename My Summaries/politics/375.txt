Mr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the "ticking bomb" of council tax revaluation, saying it was "high time" the system was replaced by a "local tax based on the ability to pay".

Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.

Mr Brown told MPs child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children.

Despite his giveaways, Budget documents show Mr Brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies.

Mr Brown said he had met his financial "golden rule" with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.
