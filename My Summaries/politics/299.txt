Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.

Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.

They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them.

The party has been "agnostic" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said.

The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID.
