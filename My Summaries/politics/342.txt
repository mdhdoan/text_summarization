Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was "in part" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy.

BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was "a warning shot" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.

The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking.

The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.
