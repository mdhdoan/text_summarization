Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was "in part" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy.

Mr Blair said he was taking "nothing for granted" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was "a warning shot" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.

The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.

Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be "central".
