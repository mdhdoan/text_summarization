Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.

He highlighted the party's promises to raise the basic state pension, provide free long-term care for the elderly and replace council tax, seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes.

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously.

"Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."

For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.
