Mr Galloway said that in next year's expected general election and local elections a year later, the party would "turn the East End of London into a fortress".

In June's European Parliament elections, Respect failed to gain enough votes for an MEP but did come first in Tower Hamlets borough, most of which is covered by the Commons constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow.

The Glasgow Kelvin MP, who was expelled from Labour over his anti Iraq war stance, accused Ms King of being a "New Labour stooge".

"I know many people around the country will be grateful, not least his constituents in Scotland who he has shamelessly abandoned."

The party's declared aims are an end to the occupation of Iraq, the repeal of anti-union laws and the end of privatisation.
