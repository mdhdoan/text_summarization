In its report on the council's work the committee said: "We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences.

The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.

The council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country.

A national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up, a committee of MPs has said.

"Major problems" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said.
