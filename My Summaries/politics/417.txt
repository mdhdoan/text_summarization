All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing.

On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was "just a cock-up" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14.

Mr Kennedy also outlined his party's plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over Â£100,000 a year.

Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament.
