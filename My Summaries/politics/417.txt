Responding to the claims Tory Party co-chairman Liam Fox said: "Like Labour, the Lib Dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving Europe more control over our lives."

Only the Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on ID cards, anti-terror measures and taxation.

On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was "just a cock-up" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14.

All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing.

Mr Kennedy also outlined his party's plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over Â£100,000 a year.
