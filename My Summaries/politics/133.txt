In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.

The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4.

Ms Jowell complained of the "scale of misrepresentation" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched.

Ms Jowell insisted: "We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing."

Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday.
