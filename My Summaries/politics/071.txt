Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused.

A Home Office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation.

Mr Leigh said the Home Office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business.

Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian "entrepreneurs".

The committee's report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year.
