Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused.

Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian "entrepreneurs".

The committee's report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year.

A Home Office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation.

Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes.
