Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave £500,000 to the party just days before Christmas.

This was a fee the firm paid for a room for an event held with the work and skills foundation during the party's conference.

This company is controlled by the party's former treasurer Lord Ashcroft which has directed almost £300,000 to specific marginal constituencies over the past two years.

The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign.

The majority of Labour's donations came from affiliated trade unions.
