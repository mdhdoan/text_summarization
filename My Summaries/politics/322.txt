The UK Independence Party, which lost its main donor Paul Sykes amid the row over Robert Kilroy-Silk's bid for the leadership last autumn, took in £63,081.

He was made a lord by Tony Blair last year.

The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign.

The Labour Party received more than £5m in donations in the final quarter of 2004, new figures show.

Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave £500,000 to the party just days before Christmas.
