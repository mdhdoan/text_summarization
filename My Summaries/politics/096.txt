Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.

Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.

The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.

Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.

Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the "great unfairness" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England.
