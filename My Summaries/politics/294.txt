Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night.

BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented "a formidable force" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election.

The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.

"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice," he said.

Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers.
