Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night.

BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented "a formidable force" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election.

The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.

The Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions.

"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice," he said.
