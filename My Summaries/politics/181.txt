"It's an important part of education and it's an important part of health," Mr Blair said.

Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London.

But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee.

The prime minister launched a Â£500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010.

He added the government had originally pledged "for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education" a week.
