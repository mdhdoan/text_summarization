Downing Street has stressed Mr Blair's support for the home secretary.

Mr Blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.

The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair.

Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a "giant mess" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary.

On Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography.
