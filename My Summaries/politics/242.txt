The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years.

The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year.

The Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year - up 22,000 on four years ago when the Act was passed.

Earlier this week, Mr Thomas said he was looking into Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.

A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records".
