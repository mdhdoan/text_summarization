The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year.

"Both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny."

But the Tories want the information commissioner to investigate.

A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records".
