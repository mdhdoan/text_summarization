But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties.

Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT.

But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.

The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power.

"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn."
