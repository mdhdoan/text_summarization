Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a "soap opera" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown.

Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of "competing agendas" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair.

It suited the purpose of Mr Baume's union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Mr Brown said: "To be honest I don't think you can rely on his [Mr Baume's] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making.

"Mr Blair and I are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms.
