Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices.

Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.

Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy.

Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs).

A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check.
