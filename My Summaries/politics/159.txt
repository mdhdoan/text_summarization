He says in the manifesto foreword: "They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair."

Mr Howard told BBC News: "I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep."

Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.

Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue "down the path of ever rising taxes".

Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain.
