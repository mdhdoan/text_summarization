Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.

"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust," he said.

He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour.

Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue "down the path of ever rising taxes".

The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values.
