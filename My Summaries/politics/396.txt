Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has written to the watchdog accusing Labour of a "flagrant and systematic breach" of the laws governing the TPS.

The Lib Dems raised worries about Labour and Conservative calls in February and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain.

The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls.

The information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the Lib Dems about how Labour uses its call centres.

The commissioner's office will now examine the Lib Dem evidence.
