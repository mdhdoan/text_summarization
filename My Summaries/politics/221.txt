The law lords' ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation.

Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as "competently possible" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice.

The home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.

Mr Clarke's comments came in response to an emergency question from Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath.

In a statement on the same day, Mr Clarke said: "I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.
