"The executive concedes that it is up to Scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.

The Scottish National Party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of Ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers.

"They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision."

"But at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised."

BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation.
