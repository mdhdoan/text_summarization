The Scottish National Party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of Ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers.

Ms Sturgeon has written to Mr McConnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out.

"They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision."

"The executive concedes that it is up to Scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.

BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation.
