Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.

Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people.

Taha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public.

Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church.

The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet.
