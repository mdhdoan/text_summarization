Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.

Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people.

It is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.

The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet.

"The people of Swansea will not put up with this."
