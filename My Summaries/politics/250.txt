We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.

Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.

We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.

We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.

It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face.
