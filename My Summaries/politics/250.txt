It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face.

We have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing.

We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.

We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.

Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.
