Mr Howard said Tory policies on schools, taxes, immigration and crime were striking a chord with voters.

Mr Howard denied he had been "playing politics" by raising the case of Margaret Dixon, whose operation had been cancelled seven times, which grabbed headlines for the party two weeks ago.

Mr Hain, Leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that Mr Howard's stance on the government's anti-terrorism legislation was putting the country at risk.

Mr Howard told his party that Labour would "do anything, say anything, claim anything to cling on to office at all costs".

Michael Howard has said a claim by Peter Hain that the Tory leader is acting like an "attack mongrel" shows Labour is "rattled" by the opposition.
