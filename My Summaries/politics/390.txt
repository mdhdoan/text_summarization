Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were "inadequate" and were "papering over the cracks of the current system".

Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.

Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.

Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a "nuclear option" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said.

Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published "in the next two weeks," a spokesman said.
