Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities, trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July.

Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort.

Mr McConnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better.

At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs.

He said 2005 must be the year that Scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world, whether in Asia or in Africa.
