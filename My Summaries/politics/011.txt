But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.

Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said.

Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign.

The Tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, Mr Fox said.

Michael Howard's ex-model wife, Sandra, is to play a leading role in the Conservative election campaign.
