But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.

Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said.

Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign.

Michael Howard's ex-model wife, Sandra, is to play a leading role in the Conservative election campaign.

The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy.
