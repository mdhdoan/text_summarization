Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules.

The measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.

But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals.

Amanda's uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: "Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence."

"The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different," he told BBC News.
