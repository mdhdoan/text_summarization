Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules.

But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned the MPs' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference.

"There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime," he said.

MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.

It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty.
