Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.

Mr Blair's government was a "bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals," he added.

This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.

The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.

Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said.
