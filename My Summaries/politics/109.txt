Mr O'Brien said: "The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring.

The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.

It showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences.

The government would play its part in "cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish", Mr O'Brien said.

Mr O'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead.
