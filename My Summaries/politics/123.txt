Mr Martin revealed some MPs had been using their Blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces.

He or she is always an MP chosen by colleagues who, once nominated, gives up all party political allegiances.

The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House.

The devices gained new prominence this week after Alastair Campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a Newsnight journalist.

MPs will be thrown out of the Commons if they use Blackberries in the chamber Speaker Michael Martin has ruled.
