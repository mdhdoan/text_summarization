National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at.

The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks.

In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.

That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between "two and three times" the commission's assessment of their likely market value.

The outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to Â£8bn.
