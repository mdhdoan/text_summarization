Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.

"It will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity," the alliance said in a statement.

The British Medical Association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others.

"We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law," he said.

It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors.
