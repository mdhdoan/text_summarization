Mr Kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned Labour voters.

But even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time.

Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.

He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour.

If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament "on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us".
