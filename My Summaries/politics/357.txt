The central government cash is part of a Â£1bn package to help local authorities in England keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year.

Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.

Ministers are unhappy about plans to use Whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down, local government minister Nick Raynsford has acknowledged.

But he said there was a recognition that "a good settlement for local government" was important to health, education and "other government departments".

Mr Raynsford said he had held some "pretty frank discussions" with fellow ministers over the plans.
