Gordon Brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-Budget report on Thursday.

"Obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this," he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.

The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in England keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year.

Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.

Mr Raynsford said he had held some "pretty frank discussions" with fellow ministers over the plans.
