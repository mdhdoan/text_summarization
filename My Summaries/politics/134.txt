"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting," he said.But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that "people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about".Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting.He said police would challenge the "one of two isolated hunts" which are threatening to break the law.
