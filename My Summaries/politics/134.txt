"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting," he said.Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force.He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police "in the near future" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions.He said police would challenge the "one of two isolated hunts" which are threatening to break the law.
