"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting," he said.

The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force.

John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices.

Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.

But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that "people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about".
