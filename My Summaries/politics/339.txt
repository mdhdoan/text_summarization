All the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of UK towns.

Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.

The party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder.

The Lib Dems say their "mutual homes" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.

Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend Â£42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.
