Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend Â£42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.

The Lib Dems say their "mutual homes" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.

Housing Minister Keith Hill said much of the Lib Dem plans mimicked the government's strategy.

"This is typical of Lib Dem hypocrisy," said Tory shadow local government secretary Caroline Spelman.

"However, as usual, the Lib Dems' proposals are completely uncosted," he said.
