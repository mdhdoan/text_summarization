Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job.

BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary.

Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story.

Reports have claimed Mr Blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny Leoncia Casalme's wait.

Shadow home secretary David Davis says Mr Blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly.
