Shadow home secretary David Davis says Mr Blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly.

Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job.

Reports have claimed Mr Blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny Leoncia Casalme's wait.

Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story.

Mr Blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to Mrs Quinn's two-year-old son.
