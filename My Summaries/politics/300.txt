Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".

But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans "stink".

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and "deeply flawed".

The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.

Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.
