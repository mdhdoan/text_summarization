The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised "extravagant" Tory promises on policing.

Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace "inconspicuous" police authorities.

"That is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions," he said.

A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary.

Responding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.
