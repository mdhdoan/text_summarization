Climate change was an issue the prime minister "wanted to progress" during the UK's presidency of the G8 and EU in 2005, said a spokesman.

Mr Blair's reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions, says the Times.

According to the Times, the UK leader wants to end US isolation with a "Kyoto-lite" agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change.

But he played down reports Mr Blair was considering a new US-friendly treaty.

Officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator John McCain recently visited Mr Blair.
