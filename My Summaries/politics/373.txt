Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was "set in stone" and there was no reason to negotiate about it.

Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.

Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.

Mr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate.
