"We have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top, who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches, to be able to stop them attending the games.

Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.

"That's the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games," she said.

"Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people."

Clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters' groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem.
