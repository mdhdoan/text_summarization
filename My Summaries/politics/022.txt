It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard.

Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU.

Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration.

He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.

Mr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services.
