Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.

It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard.

Mr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services.

Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration.

But Mr Blair said: "All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN."
