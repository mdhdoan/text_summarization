Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would "ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them".

He said Mr Blair had spoken with "such sincerity", adding: "He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone.

In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved "to be completely and publicly exonerated".

Mr Blair said: "I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice."

Tony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.
