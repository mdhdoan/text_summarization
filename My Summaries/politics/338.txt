Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the UK aimed at persuading voters his is the "real opposition".

Labour say a Lib Dem vote could "let the Tories in", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean "higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe".

Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May.

The Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue.

People vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products, the Lib Dems say.
