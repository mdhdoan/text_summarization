And Chancellor Gordon Brown said the Lib Dem figures did not add up.

Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.

The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises.

The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax.

Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises.
