On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using "grossly disproportionate" force could be prosecuted.

Tory MP Patrick Mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.

Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.

But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.
