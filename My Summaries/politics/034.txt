Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.

On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.

But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.

Mr Howard said the "grossly disproportionate" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders.

Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: "It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."
