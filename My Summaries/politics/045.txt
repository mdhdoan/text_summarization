Mr McLetchie said: "I'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement I took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded."

"The firm and I have a very good working relationship and we have done for the last six years," said Mr McLetchie.

BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell said no complaint had been made against Mr McLetchie, but questions were raised about his dual role.

Mr McLetchie said he has taken advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare.

Mr McLetchie then sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position.
