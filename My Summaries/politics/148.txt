Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.

The votes were later counted towards that month's English local elections.

The case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other Birmingham councillors in the Bordesley Green ward, claims which are denied.

They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election.

The court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning, where they were mixed in with other ballots.
