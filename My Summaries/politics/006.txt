Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured.

The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers Â£28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed.

He added: "Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole.

The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended.

The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.
