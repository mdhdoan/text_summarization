But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.

News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales.

The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as "a mess".

The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.
