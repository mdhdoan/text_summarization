News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday.

Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday.

The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as "a mess".

Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his "gracious apology" and the review itself.

But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage.
