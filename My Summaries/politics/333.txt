Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.

Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth.

UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region.

Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.

UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.
