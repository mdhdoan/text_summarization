"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe," said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled.

Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a "yes" vote.

But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as "two separate issues".

British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.

The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.
