The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.

While accepting that people "have to be prepared" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had "qualms" about the home secretary's new plans.

Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.

But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases.

The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.
