The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.

Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of "the motives of some other countries within the EU" in wanting the ban lifted.

Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained.

But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country.

He said "it is more likely than not" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July.
