Prime Minister Tony Blair called him a "giant" of the Labour movement.

Chancellor Gordon Brown said the former PM would be "mourned throughout the world".

Tory leader Michael Howard said he would be remembered with "affection and respect".

He held each of the major offices of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became Lord Callaghan of Cardiff in 1987.

When home secretary, he ordered British troops to march into the streets of Belfast to protect Catholic civilians amid rising violence - a decision that has dominated British politics into the 21st century.
