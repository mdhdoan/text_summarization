"They will be run according to British rules and we'll simply not allow any tricks which people are subjected to unawares and which increase the risk of problem gambling."

"The UK gambling industry is being totally frozen in time, and the foreign companies will take over."

"The UK industry is one of the world's most respected," he said.
