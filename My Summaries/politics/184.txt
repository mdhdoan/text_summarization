In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.

Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.

He has dealt with this time and time and time again," Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street.

Mr Blair said the statement was a "fair summary" of Lord Goldsmith's opinion.

Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.
