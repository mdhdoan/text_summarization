Mr Blair said the statement was a "fair summary" of Lord Goldsmith's opinion.

He has dealt with this time and time and time again," Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street.

This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: "Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it."

In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.

Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.
