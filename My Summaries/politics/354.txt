Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's ninth since Labour came to power in 1997.

As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy.

Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.

Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: "We can be sure of two things: the Budget will contain measures to attract votes, and it will not contain the Â£8 billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if Labour wins the election."

"In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result," said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.
