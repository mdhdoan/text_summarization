Mr Brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was Â£300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said.

Mr Brown's Budget was not about what was good for the country, but "all about the interests of the Labour party," the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign.

Mr Brown liked to rattle off "magical balances conjured out of thin air" in a bid to convince people there was no "black hole" in the nation's finances, the Tory leader said.

He went on to accuse Mr Brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other.

Labour's "faltering election campaign" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added.
