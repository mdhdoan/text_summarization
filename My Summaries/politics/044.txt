Senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the Queen and Prince of Wales are to be questioned by MPs.

It covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither Charles, nor William and Harry, receive taxpayers' money from the Civil List.

Duchy officials, who will appear before the committee on Monday, are only responsible for generating money.

But BBC correspondent Peter Hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer.

The Duchy of Cornwall is a 140,000-acre estate across 25 counties, and also includes residential properties, shops, offices, stocks and shares.
