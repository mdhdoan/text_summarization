Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.

The Refugee Council said Mr Howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.

Mr Howard has said Britain should take its fair share of the world's "genuine refugees".

The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a "clear choice" on the issue.

The home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to "ensure we can know everybody who is in the country".
