Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.

"Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."

For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.

In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections.

Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out.
