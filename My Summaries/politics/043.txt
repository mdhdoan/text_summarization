Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.

"Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."

Parties warned over 'grey vote'

In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections.

Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55.
