"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse," said Mr Blair.

Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.

On Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."

Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's "genuine refugees".

Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused.
