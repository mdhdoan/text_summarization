Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.

Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans.

The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997.

Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's "chaotic" asylum system under Tony Blair.

On Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."
