Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections.

In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour's Lorna Fitzsimons.

"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly.

Issues that Muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by UK community representatives.

The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added.
