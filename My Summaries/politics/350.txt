On Friday night, Mr Brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the Labour manifesto had been published after the Budget, expected in March.

Mr Blair has "the same passion and the same commitments for the job" as when Labour came to power in 1997, he said.

Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw "sharp dividing lines" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign.

Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election.

Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election.
