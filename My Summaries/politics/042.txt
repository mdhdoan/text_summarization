On Monday, Tony Blair's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans.

Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: "The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country."

Mr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government.

"Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away," he said.

Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May.
