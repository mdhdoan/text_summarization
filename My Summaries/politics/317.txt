They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a Â£100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down.

Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform".

A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made.

Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.
