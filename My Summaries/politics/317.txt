Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform".

The Lib Dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.

Parties' plans for council tax

The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland.

They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a "ceiling" on what the richest pay.
