Mr Brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the G8, which Britain now chairs.

Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week.

The agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries Â£3bn pounds a year, he said.

The expected deal comes as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the number of Britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached 440.

G8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster.
