Mr Brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the G8, which Britain now chairs.

Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week.

The expected deal comes as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the number of Britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached 440.

Chancellor Gordon Brown has said he hopes to announce a deal to suspend debt interest repayments by tsunami-hit nations later on Friday.

The agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries Â£3bn pounds a year, he said.
