The guidance, relating to England and Wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law.

Tory frontbencher Patrick Mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member's bill in Parliament.

The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use "reasonable force".

And the law protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

An "informal trawl" of CPS records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted.
