Before the 2001 election, plans for a debate between Mr Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy collapsed.

In 1997 a debate between Mr Blair and John Major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed.

Tony Blair has said he will not take part in a TV debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election.

"We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no," he said at his monthly news conference.
