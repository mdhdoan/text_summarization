An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street.

After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for Â£65,000 to buy a small house.

Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was "very happy" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985.

Commenting on Mr Makarov's case, he said: "The British state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week."

He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen.
