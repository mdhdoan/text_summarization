A former Home Office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor UK immigration.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate.

Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures.

She said her proposals mean "we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view."

He said: "For example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration.
