Mr Blair's official spokesman said: "The prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of European Councils.

But Mr Blair and the Labour government have been the staunchest backers of Turkish accession, provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform.

Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU.

There are also issues in France and the Netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major Muslim nation into the EU.

The Downing Street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later in the week.
