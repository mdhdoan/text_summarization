On Monday the Pakistani president met Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, on his first official visit to London.

Mr Blair said the two leaders had talked about Afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir.

But standing next to Mr Blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the "core of what creates terrorists, what creates an extremist, militant environment which then leads on to terrorism".

"We agreed that in Afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there," said Mr Blair.

Gen Musharraf told the BBC: "Some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong."
