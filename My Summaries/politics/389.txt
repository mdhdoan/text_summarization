Under Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit.

Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future.

Mr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules.

Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap.

Under Mr Brown's "sustainable investment" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.
