She told Good Morning Wales: "Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'.

"Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability."

The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.

But she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.

It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don't think the government has the expertise.
