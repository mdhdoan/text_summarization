Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries.

Mr Straw's China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers.

UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban.

The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One.

He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and China's part in the talks on North Korea.
