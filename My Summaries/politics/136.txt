UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban.

Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries.

Mr Straw's China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers.

Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections.

Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.
