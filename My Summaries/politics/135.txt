Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week.

Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.

Mr Blair insisted he had been "intimately involved" in "all decisions at all times" despite being abroad.

Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery.
