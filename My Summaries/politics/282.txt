Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning "the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto".

Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be "distracted or diverted".

Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of "misrepresenting" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans.

In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts.

"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the Â£8bn shortfall in their plans?"
