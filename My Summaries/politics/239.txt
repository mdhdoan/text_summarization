"While the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone," he said.

There are about 3,500 CSOs in England and Wales but the government intends to have 25,000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of Â£50m.

But Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers "just that little bit of edge".

The powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday.

Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.
