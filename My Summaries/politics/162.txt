The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said.

"Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century.

The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.

The TUC has called on the government to appoint "roving" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections.

"Workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety."
