Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force.

Five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them.

"We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country."

The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police.

Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder.
