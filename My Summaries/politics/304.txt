Labour's campaign cost £1.7m, the Lib Dems' £1.19m and the Greens' £404,000, according to figures revealed by the Electoral Commission on Wednesday.

The UK Independence Party outspent both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the European elections, new figures show.

But a UKIP spokesman said Labour and the Conservatives had spent £10m between them on the last general election.
