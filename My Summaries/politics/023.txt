The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but "should learn the lessons from this disaster".

A failed government scheme to offer UK university courses online has been branded a "disgraceful waste" by MPs.

With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had "too much freedom to spend public money as it wished", the report found.

The e-University was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of Â£50m.

The Commons education select committee called this "morally indefensible" but the government said the e-University project had "improved understanding".
