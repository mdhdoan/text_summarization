The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over Â£100,000.

There are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050.

They also want to set up a new "half-way house" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that "individual budget".

Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes.

And Tony Hunter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people.
