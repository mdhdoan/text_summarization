They also want to set up a new "half-way house" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that "individual budget".

There are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050.

Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes.

Health spokesman Paul Burstow said: "Promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.

The Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives.
