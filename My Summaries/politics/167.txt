Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced.

 - The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain.

The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said.

 - The government should consider a "national spatial framework" for England such as those already in place in Scotland and Wales.

The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low.
