He told BBC News: "We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well.

The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: "We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."

Tuition fees and student loans in England and Wales - and the different fee regime in Scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest.

"The issue is, I think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people."

The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.
