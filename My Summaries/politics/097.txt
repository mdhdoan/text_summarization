Home Secretary Charles Clarke told the Times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached.

He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw "in a very positive way".

"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future," he told BBC News.

But the Liberal Democrat's shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.

The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett.
