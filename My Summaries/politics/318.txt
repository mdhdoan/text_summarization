Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group.

A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament.

An Operation Black Vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet Labour party chairman Ian McCartney for discussions.

However, Labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the West Ham result.

Twelve of them represent Labour, and one is a Liberal Democrat.
