A Labour Party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for Mr Blair, but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in February.

Reports that Tony Blair is planning a snap general election for February 2005 have been described as "idle speculation" by Downing Street.

The latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a February poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over Conservative leader Michael Howard.

New Labour's campaign, both newspapers said, would be centred around the slogan "Britain is Working".

The papers report that Alan Milburn, Labour's head of elections strategy, has played a key role in the plan for a February election, which would include a New Year advertising blitz.
