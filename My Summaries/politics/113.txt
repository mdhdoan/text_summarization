Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children.

Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.

Mr Pound found out about it last year.

Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: "The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection.

Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as "Precious" at school.
