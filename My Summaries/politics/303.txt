Four hours later, Sir Edward called the Liberal leader back to Downing Street in a last attempt at a deal.

He said the Liberals could keep out Labour in three ways: lend ad hoc support to his minority government, help draw up the government's programme, or have up to three Cabinet members in a coalition with the Conservatives.

The February 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control.

Sir Edward, who had received more votes but had fewer MPs, believed he had the authority to remain at Number 10 providing the 14 Liberal MPs would support his government.

But Sir Edward said that was impossible because the Labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a Conservative-Liberal pact.
