Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans.

In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."

Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough.

As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.

And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.
