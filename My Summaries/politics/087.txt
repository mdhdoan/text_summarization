"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse," said Mr Blair.

As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.

Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough.

In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."

"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum," Mr Howard said.
