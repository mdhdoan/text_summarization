About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.

"But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges."

"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity."

Tony Hunter, the organisation's president, said: "There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Government's proposals.

The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the government's plans.
