A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.

The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up "audit trails" - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.

"It is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately."

The panel's aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating, assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right.

"Symbolically, a higher penalty, perhaps as the Bill passes through the two Houses, might be appropriate."
