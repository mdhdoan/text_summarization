Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, touring South East Asian countries, praised the "spirit of cooperation" in achieving the breakthrough.

In a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad "will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades".

Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris.

The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday.

Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process.
