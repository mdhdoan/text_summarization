Mr Brown says he discussed the election campaign with Mr Blair on Saturday and promised to play his part.

Ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock said Mr Blair and Mr Brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage Labour or British interests.

A new book, Brown's Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, says Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.

Mr Brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything Mr Blair told him.

A new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to Mr Brown to stand down before the next general election.
