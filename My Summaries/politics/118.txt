Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence.

New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.

The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses.

Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs' plan, Lord Falconer said: "One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.

"But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it's not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them."
