The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.

The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan.

Paul Boateng MP, Labour's Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: "The Lib Dems' sums don't add up.

Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to Â£150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax.

The Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers.
