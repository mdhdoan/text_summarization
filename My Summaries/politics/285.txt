"I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling."

Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a "huge boost" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench.

His determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior Conservative members, who say the party needs him.

Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench.

Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.
