Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a "huge boost" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench.

Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench.

Mr Hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister.

"I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling."

Mr Hague became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36.
