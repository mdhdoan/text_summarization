Shadow home secretary David Davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.

The Tories say Labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed.

Children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future Tory government, the party has said.

The Tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only £41m had been spent.

"We aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the UK."
