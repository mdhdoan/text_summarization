His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of "running scared" of debate.

Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw.

Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005.

Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was "fully justified".

Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.
