UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views.

He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate.

Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.

He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party.

The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk.
