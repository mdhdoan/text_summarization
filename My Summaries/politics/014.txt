Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already.

"I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk," said Mr Blair.

Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords.

Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.

In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be "far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through".
