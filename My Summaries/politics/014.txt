Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords.The government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases."I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk," said Mr Blair.Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already.A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a "basic principle" that people should only be punished after a fair trial.
