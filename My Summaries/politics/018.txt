Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will visit Auschwitz for the 60th anniversary of the former Nazi concentration camp's liberation, it has been announced.

The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been "shamed" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official.

In Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London.

"Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place."

Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz.
