Mr Blair later stressed Labour's election pledge to focus on education, when he met parents in the area.

Parents and teachers who met Mr Blair on Tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their MPs to raise concerns about education.

The pledge on education - "your child achieving more" - was one of six election pledges unveiled by Mr Blair last week.

For the Conservatives, shadow education secretary Tim Collins said: "Mr Blair&#191;s government is all talk.

"What we're doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action," Mr Blair said.
