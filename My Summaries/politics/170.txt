An English hospital has suspended plans to stop treating Welsh patients who have waited more than three months.

"In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital.

The target is 12 months for Welsh patients, but just three months in England.

"But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate," said the assembly government.

But after talks with Powys Health Board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in January.
