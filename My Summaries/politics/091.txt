The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save £100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more "intelligently" than at present.

Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: "The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year."

The party says the plans could save the average pensioner £100 every year and cut winter deaths.

The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation.

The government gives £200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or £300 where people are over 80.
