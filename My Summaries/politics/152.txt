Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken.

He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.

Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police.

Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: "There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.

The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not.
