Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police.

But the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen.

Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: "There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.

He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.

Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken.
