Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".

Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and "deeply flawed".

Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.

Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a "regressive" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.
