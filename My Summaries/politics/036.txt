The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party "fades away" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said.

Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said Charles Kennedy.

In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and "populist scares".

"Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity.

At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.
