Several people are being questioned over the attack.

He had to spend an extra 24 hours in Nairobi before rejoining the rest of the House of Commons International Development Committee in Dafur after the mugging.

An MP has had more than Â£600 and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in Kenya.

Local police were said to be "surprised" he was in the area.

Mr Davies, 60, said the mugging occurred 100 yards from the Nairobi Serena Hotel and equally close to the Anglican Cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk.
