The survey findings are being released to coincide with the launch of the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 initiative.

The Y Vote initiative is being run jointly by the Electoral Commission, the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election, possibly on 5 May.

Mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the UK.

The survey of a sample of 500 British 16 to 20-year-olds and 500 21 to 25-year olds "showed Britain's young people are far from apathetic about issues that matter to most of their lives".

"Mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters," he said.
