All five men, along with four others, are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws.

It is expected the trial could last as long as a year.

Four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed.

The accident, on 17 October 2000, happened when the London to Leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail.

The overall responsibility for the line was Railtrack's - the company that has now become Network Rail.
