Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention.

The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year.

The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was "too unlikely to have been a coincidence", Mr Beith said.

But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records".

The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.
