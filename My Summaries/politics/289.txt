As he assumes the title of Lord Kinnock, he has also become chairman of the British Council, which promotes the UK's reputation for arts, science and education.

Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has officially been made a life peer during a ceremony in the House of Lords.

"It is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression."

A former critic of the House of Lords, he has said he will use the Upper House to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education.
