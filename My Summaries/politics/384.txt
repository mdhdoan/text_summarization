UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.

Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.

"So unless the process is clearly just, the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists."

Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in "serious" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.

There have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but Mr Clarke refused to back that change.
