"We are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the Waverley Line," she said.

"We believe that it is time for the Scottish Executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future."

"Campaign for Borders Rail is the biggest independent lobby group in Scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the Borders and eventually to Carlisle.

Anne Borthwick, of Campaign for Borders Rail, said reopening the Waverley Line would restore the area's prosperity.

A study in 2000, which was commissioned by the executive, Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise, found that a half-hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its operating costs.
