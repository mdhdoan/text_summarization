Ahead of Sunday's meeting in London, Ms Hewitt said she was proud of the UK's "vibrant games industry" but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults.

Police investigating the Stefan's murder dismissed its influence and Manhunt was not part of its legal case.

Patricia Hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18-rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on Sunday.

"Video games are different to films or videos, and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do.

The government is holding a further meeting on Friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the British Board of Film Classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer.
