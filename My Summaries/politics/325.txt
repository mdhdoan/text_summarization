Veritas was formed by Mr Kilroy-Silk earlier this month after he quit UKIP following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.

"We would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done, to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election."

Mr Hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats.

But the claim was denied by UKIP spokesman, who said: "Mr Hockney's accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty."
