A report in the Sunday Business claimed Mr Brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy, while Mr Milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role.

Party strategists are believed to want to bring Mr Brown to centre-stage having seen support rise, in private polling, after his Budget last week.

Labour has always maintained Mr Brown would have a central campaign role.

Mr Johnson told BBC News: "Gordon Brown will play a central role in any election campaign.

The government has denied reports that Gordon Brown is preparing to oust Alan Milburn as Labour's election supremo.
