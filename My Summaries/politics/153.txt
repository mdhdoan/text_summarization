Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers.

Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: "We should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs... "The public are worried about this, they are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system."

Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair.

The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system.

Tony Blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no "magic bullet".
