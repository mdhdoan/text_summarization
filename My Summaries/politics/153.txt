Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: "We should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs... "The public are worried about this, they are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system."

Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair.

The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May.

The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said Labour was right to reject the Tories' idea of quotas on asylum.
