Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: "There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.

The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions.

It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to Â£3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly.

The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.

And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.
