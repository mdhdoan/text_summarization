Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world's poor nations.

Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a "scar" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic.

"The world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives.

The report said: "For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity."

Tony Blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid.
