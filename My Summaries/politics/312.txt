Five public sector unions met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead.

The five unions which met Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations.

But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April.

Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week.

The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions.
