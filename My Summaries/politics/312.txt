Five public sector unions met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead.

A spokesman for Unison, Britain's biggest union, said after Saturday's meeting: "At least we are still talking."

"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice," he said.

All sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape.

They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65.
