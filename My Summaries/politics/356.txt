Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his "golden rule".

In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year.

Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were "affordable" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising.

Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the "cornerstone" of Labour's programme.
