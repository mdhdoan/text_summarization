The author's sources, all unnamed "allies" of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, said the prime minister felt the Iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party.

Tony Blair promised Gordon Brown he would stand down before the next election, a new book about the chancellor claims.
