Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system.

The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.

Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out.

But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.

The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud.
