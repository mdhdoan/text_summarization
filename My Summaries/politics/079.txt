Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system.

The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.

Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out.

The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover.

And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check.
