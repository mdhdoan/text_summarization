Less than half the UK wants a ban compared to almost two-thirds in 1999, the Mori survey of 2,000 adults for BBC One's Countryfile programme suggests.

Most city-dwellers support the ban but rural people were evenly split between supporters, opponents and undecided.

Support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years, a poll suggests.

But the programme makers suggest the British public are becoming "increasingly neutral" to the issue because around one quarter said they "neither support nor oppose" a ban.

For Countryfile they asked 2,234 adults across the country the same question.
