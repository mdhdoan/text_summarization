Labour's Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.

However, Mr Johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair "should butt out of" the row.

Mr Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was "an attempt to reassure Jewish voters".

"I don't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this," The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

London mayor Mr Livingstone says he is "standing by" his remarks which likened an Evening Standard journalist to a "concentration camp guard".
