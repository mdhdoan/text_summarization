The Conservatives' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned Michael Howard the party could not win the next general election.

Mr Crosby's statement said: "The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week."

Mr Howard later added there was not "one iota" of truth in the report.

It added: "The Labour Party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people."

Mr Howard appointed Mr Crosby as his elections chief last October.
