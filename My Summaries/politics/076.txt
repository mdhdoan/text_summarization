A National Audit Office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by Â£1.7bn in the past year.

Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was "obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown", but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had "undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects".

"Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase," the report says.

It says there is "little evidence" the MoD's performance had improved, despite the introduction of a "smart acquisition" policy six years ago.

A senior defence official, speaking to the BBC's defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle.
