But Mr Jack said the bill "very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that "an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms.

Committee chairman Michael Jack said: "Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.

My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place."

"The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament," he added.

The MPs said they were "concerned" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.
