But Mr Jack said the bill "very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that "an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms.

The MPs said they were "concerned" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.

"The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament," he added.

Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.

The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which "would be significantly weakened".
