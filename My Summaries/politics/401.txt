Mr Blair has so far resisted calls for him to name the day but all parties have stepped up campaigning recently.

Andrew Marr says Mr Blair will ask the Queen on 4 or 5 April to dissolve Parliament at the end of that week.

Mr Marr said on Wednesday's Today programme: "There's almost nobody at a senior level inside the government or in Parliament itself who doesn't expect the election to be called on 4 or 5 April.

The government needs its finance bill, covering the Budget plans, to be passed before the Commons closes for business at the end of the session on 7 April.

The move will signal a frantic week at Westminster as the government is likely to try to get key legislation through Parliament.
