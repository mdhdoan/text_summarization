The documentary showed some of the tensions between Mr Kilroy-Silk and his fellow MEPs after UKIP took third place in last year's European elections.

The film also included footage of a row between Mr Kilroy-Silk, MEP Nigel Farage and party leader Roger Knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the UKIP whip in the European Parliament.

Mr Kilroy-Silk told them he had not left the UKIP group - a move he announced shortly after the meeting.

Mr Kilroy-Silk separately said he had argued against UKIP working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin.

He did not defend other groups' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as Mr Kilroy-Silk had a right to criticise Arab states.
