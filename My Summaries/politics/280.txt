Following claims that US forces had worked inside Iran to identify potential targets, Mr Blair was asked if the SAS had also been in the country.

Mr Blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights.

Mr Blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with Mr Bush.

Turning to critics' fears that the US was poised for further military action, Mr Blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against Iran.

He understood that "the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper.
