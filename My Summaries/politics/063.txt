Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: "Christmas Day and New Year's Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special.

"The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family."

In recent years, more stores have been opening on traditional holidays, with some starting their end-of-year sale on Christmas Day or New Year's Day.

"We want people to tell Karen, through her consultation, whether they want the special nature of these days to remain, or whether they want them to become like any other trading day, with shops open for business as usual."

Efforts are being made to 'protect' workers' days off on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.
