"I think this initiative from America to set up four countries claiming to co-ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the UN when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up," she said.

Ms Short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters.

"I don't know what that is about but it sounds very much, I am afraid, like the US trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the UN system," she added.

"Only really the UN can do that job," she told BBC Radio Four's PM programme.

The US was "very bad at coordinating with anyone" and India had its own problems, Ms Short said.
