A group of MPs are on a two-day fact-finding mission to Scotland to gather evidence for a report into the UK's fishing industry.

Six members of the committee will be in Scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in Aberdeen and Peterhead.

Committee chairman Austin Mitchell said some way has to be found of harvesting mixed fisheries without wasting stocks.

Details are contained in a Royal Commission report for the UK Government, along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely.

Members of Westminster's environment, food and rural affairs committee will be touring fish markets and talking to fish processors.
