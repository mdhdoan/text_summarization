An explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons.

Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: "We are being advised by the police and the security services... "What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt.

Mr Blair told the BBC the "control orders" would only be used in the most limited circumstances.

But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in "rushing" anti-terrorism legislation.

He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that "he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward".
