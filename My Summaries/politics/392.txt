Mr Brown, on a week-long tour of Africa, spent two days in Tanzania before heading on Friday evening to Mozambique, a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.

Mr Brown said that missionairies had come to Africa because of their sense of duty.

Mr Brown has signed a debt relief deal with Tanzania which could cost the UK £1 billion.

The days of Britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, Gordon Brown has said.

Under the plan - which could cost the UK £1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health, education and welfare.
