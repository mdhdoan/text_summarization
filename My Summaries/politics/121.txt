Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%.

"However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England," he said.

On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.

Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.

"But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long."
