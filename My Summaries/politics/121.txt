Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%.

On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.

"However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England," he said.

There are 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.

Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.
