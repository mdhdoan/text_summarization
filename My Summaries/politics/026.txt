Mr Blair told a news conference: "It will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there.

Mr Blair has vowed to put Africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the G8.

The Commission for Africa's report will be released on 11 March - Comic Relief day, Tony Blair has said.

The people involved include two African government leaders and a range of other African politicians, as well as experts from some other developed countries.

July's G8 summit in Gleneagles in Perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on Africa.
