Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role.

Labour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda.

A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role.

But Mr Wyatt argued: "By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world.

"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back."
