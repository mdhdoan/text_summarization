The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been "trying very hard" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a "sort of campaign of trust".

Labour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda.

Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role.

A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role.

But Mr Blair had been "hurt" by the Iraq controversy, he added.
