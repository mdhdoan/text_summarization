He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls.

A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.

Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.

"If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned," said Mr Jones.

The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.
