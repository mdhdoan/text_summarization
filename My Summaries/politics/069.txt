Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead.

In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes.

"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice," he said.

However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape.

They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65.
