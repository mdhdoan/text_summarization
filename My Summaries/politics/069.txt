Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead.

But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April.

The five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations.

Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week.

The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions.
