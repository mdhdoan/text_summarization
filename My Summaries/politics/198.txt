Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a "tiny minority" of violent binge drinkers.

His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government's plans be put on hold.

Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours."

However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking.

A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.
