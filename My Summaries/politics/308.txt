Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament.

He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes.

Meyer's constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge.

That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot.

He was 84, had been suffering from cancer for many months, and died at his London home.
