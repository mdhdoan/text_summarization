At a news conference, Mr Howard insisted he had played by the party's rules.

The comments were not a "one-off", he said, claiming Mr Howard and other senior Tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending.

It has also emerged Mr Howard has suspended Slough's constituency Conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate.

He said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the BBC News website on Monday evening.

The MP, who is consulting his lawyers, told BBC News: "They selected me and they, if you like, dispose of me or keep me."
