Mr Brown has headed Labour's preparations for previous polls but Mr Milburn is taking that role this time.

But Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said Labour's plans showed Mr Blair was "terrified of facing proper scrutiny".

"At a time when the British people are looking for more accountability and openness, this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question, 'What have they got to hide?'"

Instead Mr Blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the party's message.

Mr Milburn said Labour's media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters, with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister.
