Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News people's lives "revolved around hunting".

Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law.

But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits.

Hunts in England and Wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later.

He described the ban as "ridiculous" and "badly thought out" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.
