Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: "We've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do.

The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions.

Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News people's lives "revolved around hunting".

Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law.

She said many people did not share the Countryside Alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue.
