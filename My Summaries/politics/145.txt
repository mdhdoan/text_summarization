A prospective candidate for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) has resigned after admitting a "brief attachment" to the British National Party(BNP).

A UKIP spokesman said Mr Betts-Green's resignation followed disclosures in the East Anglian Daily Times last month about his attendance at a BNP meeting.

Mr Betts-Green resigned after being questioned by the party's leadership.

Nicholas Betts-Green, who had been selected to fight the Suffolk Coastal seat, quit after reports in a newspaper that he attended a BNP meeting.

Mr Betts-Green, of Woodbridge, Suffolk, has also resigned as UKIP's branch chairman.
