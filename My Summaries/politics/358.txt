Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to "see the light" on the rebate.

Mr Straw said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.

The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the Commission wants it to be 1.26%.

He added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the UK's stance - Britain contributed more and received less than other EU states.

Britain's Â£3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said.
