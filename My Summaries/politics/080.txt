When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was "only the start of the journey".

The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year.

Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: "This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life.

Education minister Ivan Lewis said: "We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace."

The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.
