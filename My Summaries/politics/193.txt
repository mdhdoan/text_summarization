Mr Blair told his monthly news conference Britain had the "best of both worlds" and would keep the veto.

Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.

Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.
