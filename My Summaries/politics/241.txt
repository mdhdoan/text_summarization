He told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme: "Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.

Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: "Last week in parliament I announced an additional Â£419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland.

Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.
