Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as "deeply flawed" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.

Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government's plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.

New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to "pause for thought" from Charles Kennedy.

The Lib Dem leader said David Blunkett's resignation was a "good opportunity" to question whether the legislation was necessary.

But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.
