The Lib Dem leader said David Blunkett's resignation was a "good opportunity" to question whether the legislation was necessary.

But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.

Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as "deeply flawed" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.

The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.

Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government's plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.
