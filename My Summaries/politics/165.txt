Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing.

New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs.

The police's job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.

Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes.

Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs.
