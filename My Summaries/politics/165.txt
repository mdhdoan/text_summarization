Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing.

The police's job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.

Mr Fox's comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock.

New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs.

Mr Fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.
