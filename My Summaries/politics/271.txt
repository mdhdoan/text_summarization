Mr Howard said: "All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less."

Mr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday.

Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election.

"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes," Mr Howard insisted.

The bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said.
