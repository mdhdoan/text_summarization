The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour.

Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: "People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of Â£35bn worth of savings.

Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election.

"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes," Mr Howard insisted.
