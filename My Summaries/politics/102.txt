In his first comments since Sir Alan's announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail.

At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.

The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a "grubby government".

Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan's findings.

But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance.
