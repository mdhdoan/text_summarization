Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.

At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.

In his first comments since Sir Alan's announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail.

Earlier, Mr Howard said: "There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry.

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was "a strong case for a judge-led judicial review".
