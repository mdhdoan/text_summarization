The poll comes after Foreign Secretary Jack Straw predicted trust would be "the key choice" at the next election.

The Lib Dems are also keen to highlight the trust issue, with Charles Kennedy has claiming voters had a "fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister".

Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said the Iraq war had hit trust in politicians hard.

During his response to Gordon Brown's Budget statement on Tuesday, Michael Howard compared the chancellor's figures to the prime minister's claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

Both the Tories and the Lib Dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in Tony Blair, following his claims over Iraqi weapons.
