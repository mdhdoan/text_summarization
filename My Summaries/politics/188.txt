An inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the Pakistani president's visit to London were found by a member of the public.

Gen Musharraf held talks with Tony Blair on Monday.

The papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in Mayfair and given to the Mirror newspaper.

The police spokesman said the newspaper handed the report over on Monday.

He arrived in Britain on Sunday night after flying from the United States, where he met President George W Bush.
